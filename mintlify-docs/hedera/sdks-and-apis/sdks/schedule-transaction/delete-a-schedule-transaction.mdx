title: "Delete a schedule transaction"
---


A `ScheduleDeleteTransaction` is a consensus node transaction that removes a scheduled transaction from the network. A scheduled transaction can only be deleted if an admin key was set during its creation. If no admin key was set, any attempt to delete it will result in a `SCHEDULE_IS_IMMUTABLE` response from the network. Once successfully deleted, the scheduled transaction will be marked as deleted, and the consensus timestamp of the deletion will be recorded.

**Transaction Signing Requirements**

* The signature of the admin key

| Field           | Description                        |

//Sign with the operator key and submit to a Hedera network

//Get the transaction receipt

//Get the transaction status
Status transactionStatus = receipt.status;
System.out.println("The transaction consensus status is " +transactionStatus);
```


```javascript JavaScript

//Get the transaction status
const transactionStatus = receipt.status;

```go Go
//Create the transaction and freeze the unsigned transaction

}

//Sign with the admin key, sign with the client operator private key and submit the transaction to a Hedera network

//Request the receipt of the transaction
receipt, err := txResponse.GetReceipt(client)

//Get the transaction consensus status

fmt.Printf("The transaction consensus status is %v\n", status)

```rust Rust
