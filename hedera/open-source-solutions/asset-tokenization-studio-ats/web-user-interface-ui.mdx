    New bonds are debt securities issued by entities (corporate or government) to raise money. Investors receive periodic interest (coupons) and the principal at maturity. Tokenizing a bond digitally represents it on the blockchain or other form of distributed ledger, allowing fractional ownership and easier transferability of tokens.

    New equity represents ownership in a company or asset, entitling holders to a share of assets, profits, dividends, and voting rights. Through asset tokenization, digital tokens representing shares are issued on a blockchain or other form of distributed ledger, offering investors easy access, transferability, and voting rights.

## Regulations

Before we start tokenizing assets into digital securities, let's review some important regulatory information to understand the applicable restrictions and rules for both types (bonds and equities) of securities that ATS supports. The current jurisdiction for digital securities is limited to the United States, meaning all legal and regulatory frameworks concerning the issuance, management, and trading of the tokenized asset are in conformity with U.S. laws. While designed to be flexible for more jurisdictions in the near future, for the time being, all the offerings of tokenized instruments shall fall under the ambit of American laws.

<Warning>
**Important**: Please read the restrictions applicable to the selected regulation carefully and ensure your deal is compliant. Once published, these details cannot be altered. It is recommended to consult your legal and financial advisor for regulations applicable to your digital security.

## Manage Roles

In Asset Tokenization Studio (ATS), role management is a crucial feature that provides control over various functions related to the management and operation of digital securities. If your account is assigned the *Admin Role*, you can manage other roles for your security tokens, making governance easier and more secure.

<Warning>
To operate and manage digital securities within Asset Tokenization Studio, you must first assign roles to your connected wallet or account. Without the appropriate roles, you will not have the necessary permissions to perform operations such as minting tokens, managing corporate actions, or updating compliance settings. Be sure to grant yourself the required roles through the role management tab for each security to gain full access to manage your tokenized assets.
</Warning>

Roles you can manage include:

* **Admin**: Grants full administrative privileges, including the ability to assign and manage all other roles.
* **Minter**: Permits the account to mint new tokens, increasing the supply of the asset.
* **Controller**: Authorizes the account to execute specific control actions over the tokenized asset, such as regulatory or operational updates.
* **Pause**: Allows the account to temporarily halt all transactions for the asset, useful in emergencies or during maintenance.
* **Control List**: Manages approval lists and blacklists, determining which accounts can or cannot participate in asset transactions.
* **Corporate Actions**: Enables the execution of corporate actions like dividend distributions or token conversions.
* **Document**: Grants the ability to manage and update asset-related documents, such as legal or compliance files.
* **Snapshot**: Authorizes the creation of snapshots, capturing the state of token holder balances at a specific point in time for reporting or auditing purposes.

Connect your wallet and select the digital security you want to manage from the Admin (mode) dashboard.

<Frame>

</Frame>

Once the asset information loads, navigate to the "Role Management" tab to assign or modify roles. Enter the account ID to which you want to assign roles.

## Manage Securities

After assigning roles, ATS will display all operations available for each digital security based on the roles your account has been assigned. Simply click on the corresponding tab and follow the on-screen prompts to complete each operation. Here's a rundown of the available operations by dashboard mode:

#### Admin (mode) Dashboard

* **Mint**: Allows the creation of new tokens for the security, increasing the total supply based on the issuer’s parameters.
* **Force Transfer**: Enables the transfer of tokens from one account to another without the token holder's consent, often used in cases of legal or regulatory necessity.
* **Dividends**: Programs dividend payments for equity tokens, specifying how and when dividends will be distributed to token holders. It also provides an overview of all programmed dividend payouts, including past, pending, or upcoming payments, allowing the issuer or investor to track distributions.
* **Balances**: Shows the balance of tokens held by various investors, offering a snapshot of current token holdings for the selected security.
* **Blocked List**: Manages a list of blocked or restricted investors who are prohibited from participating in token transactions, ensuring compliance with KYC/AML requirements.
* **Voting Rights**: Assigns, adjusts, or displays voting rights for security token holders, allowing them to participate in governance decisions, such as corporate actions or board elections.
* **Role Management**: Enables the assignment and management of roles (e.g., Admin, Minter, Controller) for specific users, determining their permissions and access to various operations within the digital security.
