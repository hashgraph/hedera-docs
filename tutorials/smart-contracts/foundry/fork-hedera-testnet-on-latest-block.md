# How to Fork Testnet on Latest Block

## What you will accomplish

* [ ] Deploy your smart contract to Hedera Testnet using `forge create`
* [ ] Use `cast send` to sign and publish a transaction that changes the state.

Open your terminal, and enter the following commands.

```shell
git --version
code --version
node --version
npm --version
forge --version
cast --version
```

Each of these commands should output some text that includes a version number, for example:

```
git --version
git version 2.39.2 (Apple Git-143)

code --version
1.81.1
6c3e3dba23e8fadc360aed75ce363ba185c49794
arm64

node --version
v20.6.1

npm --version
9.8.1

forge --version
0.2.0 (3cdee82 2024-02-15T00:19:38.655803000Z)

cast --version
0.2.0 (3cdee82 2024-02-15T00:19:38.543163000Z)

```

If the output contains text similar to `command not found`, please install that item.

## Get started

### Set up project

To follow along, start with the `main` branch, which is the _default branch_ of this repository. This gives you the initial state from which you can follow along with the steps as described in the tutorial.

`forge` manages dependencies by using git submodules. Clone the following project and pass `--recurse-submodules` to the `git clone` command to automatically initialize and update the submodule in the repository.

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:hedera-dev/fork-hedera-testnet.git
```

### Install the submodule dependencies

```shell
forge install
```

### Copy Your ECDSA Hex Encoded Private Key

Grab your ECDSA hex encoded private key by logging into [Hedera Portal](https://portal.hedera.com).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you need to create a Hedera account, follow the [create a hedera portal profile faucet](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/getting-started/introduction#create-hedera-portal-profile-faucet) tutorial.
{% endhint %}

### Deploy your contract to Hedera Testnet

In your terminal, replace the value of `"HEX_Encoded_Private_Key"` with your `ECDSA` account's private key in the command below:

Next, Replace "RPC\_URL" with a Tesnet URL by choosing one of the options over at [How to Connect to Hedera Networks Over RPC](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/tutorials/more-tutorials/json-rpc-connections)

```shell
forge create --rpc-url "RPC_URL" --private-key "HEX_Encoded_Private_Key" src/TodoList.sol:TodoList
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Your hex encoded private key must be prefixed with \`0x\`.
{% endhint %}

You should see output similar to the following:

```
[⠒] Compiling...
[⠔] Compiling 22 files with 0.8.23
[⠑] Solc 0.8.23 finished in 3.44s
Compiler run successful!
No files changed, compilation skipped

```

Open the Hashscan link to your deployed contract by copying the **Deployed to** EVM address and replacing \<Deployed\_Contract\_EVM\_Address> in the link below:

```
https://hashscan.io/testnet/contract/<Deployed_Contract_EVM_Address>
```

{% hint style="success" %}
Example: https://hashscan.io/testnet/contract/0xc1E551Eb1B3430A8D373C43e8804561fca5ce90D
{% endhint %}

### Execute a contract call and create a new todo

Use Foundry's `cast send` command to sign and publish a transaction to Hedera Tesnet.

In your terminal, you will need to replace the following items in the command below:

* Replace `"deployed-contract-EVM-address"` with your deployed contracts EVM address
* Replace`"HEX_Encoded_Private_Key"` with your hex encoded private key.
* Replace `"RPC_URL"` with a Tesnet URL.

```shell
cast send "deployed-contract-EVM-address" --private-key "HEX_Encoded_Private_Key" "createTodo(string)(uint256)" "Buy camping supplies"  --rpc-url "RPC_URL" 
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
blockHash               0x958f246cc010aa074c81eae1988abc16c16bc12d2246397320d163b5ea748a89

transactionIndex        2
type                    2
```

Use `cast call` to execute `TodoList.sol`'s `numberOfTodos()`.

```shell
cast call "deployed-contract-EVM-address" "numberOfTodos()(uint256)" --rpc-url "RPC_URL"
```

You should see `numberOftodos` has incremented by 1.

{% hint style="warning" %}
`cast send` signs/publishes a transaction and changes the state.

`cast call` performs a call without changing state. Essentially a read transaction.
{% endhint %}

### Write your test

An almost-complete test has already been prepared for you. It's located at `test/TodoList.t.sol`. You will only need to make a few modifications (outlined below) for it to run successfully.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Look for a comment in the code to locate the specific lines of code which you will need to edit. For example, in this step, look for this: `// Step (1) in the accompanying tutorial` You will need to delete the inline comment that looks like this: `/* ... */`. Replace it with the correct code.
{% endhint %}

#### Step 1: Target your deployed contract

Open the `TodoList.t.sol` file and copy and paste the line below.

Replace `"Deployed_Contract_EVM_Address"` with your deployed contract's EVM address.

```solidity
    TodoList public todoList =
        TodoList("Deployed_Contract_EVM_Address");
```

#### Step 2: Perform an assertion

This test saves the current number of todos as `numberOfTodos`, then executes `createTodo()`, and finally performs an assertion to check that the new number of todos has increased.

Write a statement which asserts that the `todoCountAfterCreate` is equal to the `numberOfTodos + 1`.

Copy the below line and paste it in `TodoList.t.sol`

```solidity
assertEq(todoCountAfterCreate, (numberOfTodos + 1));
```

### Fork test Hedera Testnet and run your test

Using the `--fork-url` flag you will run your test against a forked Hedera Testnet environment at the latest block.

In your terminal, replace "RPC\_URL" with a Tesnet URL

```shell
forge test --fork-url "RPC_URL" -vvvv
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
[⠢] Compiling...
[⠰] Compiling 1 files with 0.8.23
[⠔] Solc 0.8.23 finished in 1.15s
Compiler run successful!

Running 1 test for test/TodoList.t.sol:TodoListTest
[PASS] test_createTodo_returnsNumberOfTodosIncrementedByOne() (gas: 59188)
Traces:
  [59188] TodoListTest::test_createTodo_returnsNumberOfTodosIncrementedByOne()
    ├─ [2325] 0xc1E551Eb1B3430A8D373C43e8804561fca5ce90D::getNumberOfTodos() [staticcall]
    │   └─ ← 1
    ├─ [51026] 0xc1E551Eb1B3430A8D373C43e8804561fca5ce90D::createTodo("A new todo for you!")
    │   └─ ← 2
    └─ ← ()

Test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 2.13s
 
Ran 1 test suites: 1 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (1 total tests)
```

Your output will show you the state of `numberOfTodos` before you created a new todo and after. It also shows whether the test passed, failed or was skipped.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you'd like to test a contract deployed on mainnet use a Mainnet RPC URL. Currently fork testing at the latest block is only supported. Be aware everytime you run your test it is against the latest state of the network.
{% endhint %}
