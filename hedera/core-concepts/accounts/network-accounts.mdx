### Account Details

#### Fee Collection Account (`0.0.802`)
Introduced in [HIP-1259](/hedera/hip/hip-1259), this account serves as a temporary holding account for all transaction fees. It is fully code-controlled, has no keys, and cannot accept HBAR deposits from users. This design simplifies transaction records and improves network efficiency.

#### Staking Rewards Account (`0.0.800`)
This account holds the HBAR that will be distributed to users who are staking their tokens. It receives a portion of the daily accumulated fees from the Fee Collection Account. While it does not have keys, it can accept HBAR donations from the community.

#### Node Rewards Account (`0.0.801`)
This account holds the HBAR that will be distributed to node operators for their services. It receives a portion of the daily accumulated fees from the Fee Collection Account. It does not have keys and cannot accept HBAR deposits.

#### Network Funding Account (`0.0.98`)
The network funding account is the primary recipient of transaction fees, receiving the largest portion of the daily distribution. These funds are used to support the long-term growth and development of the Hedera network
