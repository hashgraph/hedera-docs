# Dissociate tokens from an account

Dissociates the provided Hedera account from the provided Hedera tokens. This transaction must be signed by the provided account's key. Once the association is removed, no token-related operation can be performed to that account. AccountBalanceQuery and AccountInfoQuery will not return anything related to the dissociated token.

* If the provided account is not found, the transaction will resolve to `INVALID_ACCOUNT_ID`.
* If the provided account has been deleted, the transaction will resolve to `ACCOUNT_DELETED`.
* If any of the provided tokens is not found, the transaction will resolve to `INVALID_TOKEN_REF`.
* If an association between the provided account and any of the tokens does not exist, the transaction will resolve to `TOKEN_NOT_ASSOCIATED_TO_ACCOUNT`.
* If the provided account has a nonzero balance with any of the provided tokens, the transaction will resolve to `TRANSACTION_REQUIRES_ZERO_TOKEN_BALANCES`.
* On success, associations between the provided account and tokens are removed.

{% hint style="info" %}
The account is required to have a zero balance of the token you wish to dissociate. If a token balance is present, you will receive a `TRANSACTION_REQUIRES_ZERO_TOKEN_BALANCES` error.
{% endhint %}

**Transaction Signing Requirements**

* The key of the account the token is being dissociated with
* Transaction fee payer account key

**Transaction Fees**

* Please see the transaction and query [fees](../../../networks/mainnet/fees/#transaction-and-query-fees) table for base transaction fee
* Please use the [Hedera fee estimator](https://hedera.com/fees) to estimate your transaction fee cost
