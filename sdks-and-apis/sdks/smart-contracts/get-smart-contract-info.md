# Get smart contract info

A query that returns the current state of a smart contract instance, including its balance. Queries do not change the state of the smart contract or require network consensus. The information is returned from a single node processing the query.

In Services release 0.50, Returning token balance information from the consensus node was deprecated with HIP-367. This query now returns token information by requesting the information from the Hedera Mirror Node APIs via [/api/v1/accounts/{id}/tokens](https://mainnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/docs/#/accounts/listTokenRelationshipByAccountId). Token symbol is not returned in the response.

| Field                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Contract ID**         | ID of the contract instance, in the format used in transactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Account ID**          | ID of the cryptocurrency account owned by the contract instance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Contract Account ID** | ID of both the contract instance and the cryptocurrency account owned by the contract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Admin Key**           | The state of the instance and its fields can be modified arbitrarily if this key signs a transaction to modify it. If this is null, then such modifications are not possible, and there is no administrator that can override the normal operation of this smart contract instance. Note that if it is created with no admin keys, then there is no administrator to authorize changing the admin keys, so there can never be any admin keys for that instance. |
| **Expiration Time**     | The current time at which this contract instance (and its account) is set to expire.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Auto Renew Period**   | The expiration time will extend every this many seconds. If there are insufficient funds, then it extends as long as possible. If the account is empty when it expires, then it is deleted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Storage**             | Number of bytes of storage being used by this instance (which affects the cost to extend the expiration time).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **Deleted**             | Whether the contract has been deleted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
