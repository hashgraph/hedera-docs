The [**Hedera Contract Builder**](https://portal.hedera.com/contract-builder) is a browser-based tool designed to simplify and accelerate the smart contract development lifecycle on the Hedera network. It allows developers to edit, compile, deploy, verify, and call Solidity smart contracts directly in their browser, eliminating the need for complex local setups or command-line tools.

## Key Features & Benefits

The Contract Builder is packed with features to make development smoother and faster for developers by offering:

* **Rapid Development:** Go from idea to deployed contract on the Hedera testnet in seconds. Author, compile, and deploy with just a few clicks.
* **No Setup Required:** Access everything you need directly in your browser. No need to install packages or configure local environments.
* **Built-in Templates & Standards:** Start quickly with pre-built templates and support for common standards like ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, and Hedera Token Service (HTS) system contracts.
* **Seamless Workflow:** Easily verify your contract code using [Sourcify](https://verify.hashscan.io/) on [HashScan](https://hashscan.io/) and execute contract functions to test logic.
* **Collaboration:** Share your contracts with collaborators to streamline teamwork.
* **Open Source:** Built in collaboration with [Kabila](https://www.kabila.app/), the Contract Builder is an open-source project, encouraging community contributions and transparency.

## Who Is It For?

The Hedera Contract Builder is ideal for:

* **Web2 Developers:** A perfect entry point into web3 and smart contract development, offering an intuitive interface and interactive templates to learn and experiment with minimal Solidity knowledge.
* **Existing Hedera & Web3 Developers:** A productivity tool for rapid prototyping, testing new contract logic, or exploring Hedera's smart contract capabilities without a full development environment setup.
