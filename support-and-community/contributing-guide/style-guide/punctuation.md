# Punctuation

### Oxford comma

The Oxford comma is the comma used immediately before the coordinating conjunction ("and" or "or") in a list of three or more items. In our written content, the use of the Oxford comma is required to maintain clarity and prevent ambiguity.

**Example**: "The team consists of product managers, developers, designers, and writers."

By consistently applying the Oxford comma, we ensure that the meaning of lists is clear, especially when individual items contain commas themselves. This standard reflects our dedication to ensuring clear and accurate communication in all of our documentation.
