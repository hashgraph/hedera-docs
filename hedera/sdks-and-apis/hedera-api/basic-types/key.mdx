title: "Key"

A Key can be a public key from either the Ed25519 or ECDSA(secp256k1) signature schemes, where in the ECDSA(secp256k1) case we require the 33-byte compressed form of the public key. We call these public keys **primitive keys**.

If an account has primitive key associated to it, then the corresponding private key must sign any transaction to transfer cryptocurrency out of it. A Key can also be the ID of a smart contract instance, which is then authorized to perform any precompiled contract action that requires this key to sign.

Note that when a Key is a smart contract ID, it *doesn't* mean the contract with that ID will actually create a cryptographic signature. It only means that when the contract calls a precompiled contract, the resulting "child transaction" will be authorized to perform any action controlled by the Key.

A Key can be a "threshold key", which means a list of M keys, any N of which must sign in order for the threshold signature to be considered valid. The keys within a threshold signature may themselves be threshold signatures, to allow complex signature requirements.

A Key can be a "key list" where all keys in the list must sign unless specified otherwise in the documentation for a specific transaction type (e.g. FileDeleteTransactionBody). Their use is dependent on context. For example, a Hedera file is created with a list of keys, where all of them must sign a transaction to create or modify the file, but only one of them is needed to sign a transaction to delete the file. So it's a single list that sometimes acts as a 1-of-M threshold key, and sometimes acts as an M-of-M threshold key. A key list is always an M-of-M, unless specified otherwise in documentation. A key list can have nested key lists or threshold keys.Nested key lists are always M-of-M. A key list can have repeated primitive public keys, but all repeated keys are only required to sign once.

A Key can contain a ThresholdKey or KeyList, which in turn contain a Key, so this mutual recursion would allow nesting arbitrarily deep. A ThresholdKey which contains a list of primitive keys has 3 levels: ThresholdKey -> KeyList -> Key. A KeyList which contains several primitivekeys has 2 levels: KeyList -> Key. A Key with 2 levels of nested ThresholdKeys has 7 levels: Key -> ThresholdKey -> KeyList -> Key -> ThresholdKey -> KeyList -> Key.

Each Key should not have more than 46 levels, which implies 15 levels of nested ThresholdKeys.
