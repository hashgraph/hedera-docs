<Info>
This feature is available in the [Hedera JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-sdk-js) only. (version >=2.14.0).
</Info>

The `Wallet` extends the `Signer`. The `Signer` is responsible for `Signing` requests while the `Provider` is responsible for communication between an application and a Hedera network, but is not required to communicate directly with a Hedera network. Note this means the `Provider` can for instance communicate with some third party service which finally communicates with a Hedera network.

## class Wallet extends Signer

### Constructor

**`new Wallet(<accountId>, <privateKey>, <provider>)`**

Constructs a local wallet from an account ID, private key, and provider.

### **Methods**

**`<Wallet>.getLedgerId()`->** **`LedgerId`**

Returns the ledger ID.

**`<Wallet>.getAccountId()`->`AccountId`**

Returns the account ID associated with this signer.

**`<Wallet>.getAccountKey()`->`Key`**

Returns the account key.

**`<Wallet>.getNetwork()`->[`Key:string]: string`**

Returns the full consensus network being used.

**`<Wallet>.getMirrorNetwork()`->string[]**

Returns the mirror node for the network.

**`<Wallet>.sign (messages; Uint8Array[])`->** **`Promise<SignerSignature[]>`**

Sign an arbitrary list of messages.

**`<Wallet>.getAccountBalance()`->** **`Promise<AccountBalance>`**

Returns the account balance.

**`<Wallet>.getAccountInfo`()->** **`Promise<AccountInfo>`**

Returns the account info.

**`<Wallet>.getAccountRecords`()->** **`Promise<TransactionRecord[]>`**

Fetch the last transaction records for this account using `TransactionRecordQuery`.

**`<Wallet>.getProvider`()->**** `Provider`**

Returns the Hedera network.

**`<Wallet>.signTransaction <T extends Transaction>(transaction:T` )->** **`Promise<T>`**

Signs a transaction, returning the signed transaction

**NOTE**: This method is allowed to mutate the parameter being passed in so the returned transaction is not guaranteed to be a new instance of the transaction.

**`<Wallet>.checkTransaction<T extends Transaction>`** **( `transaction`: `T` )-> `Promise<T>`**

Check whether all the required fields are set appropriately. Fields such as the transaction ID's account ID should either be `null` or be equal to the signer's account ID, and the node account IDs on the request should exist within the signer's network.

**`<Wallet>.populateTransaction<T extends Transaction>`** **( `transaction`: `T` )-> `Promise<T>`**

Populate the requests with the required fields. The transaction ID should be constructed from the signer's account ID, and the node account IDs should be set using the signer's network.

**`<Wallet>.call(<RequestT, ResponseT, OutputT>(request: Executable<RequestT, ResponseT, OutputT>)`->** **`Promise <Output>`**

Responsible for serializing your request and sending it over the wire to be executed, and then deserializing the response into the appropriate type.

Note: This is a wrapper around the `Provider.call()` method.
