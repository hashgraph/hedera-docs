# Use of HBAR and tinybars

### HBAR

When referring to the Hedera native currency, use the singular form of the noun **HBAR**. For example:

* "I bought 10 **HBAR** yesterday"

Do not use the plural form of the noun, as this style rule applies even when referring to multiple units of **HBAR**.

### tinybars

When referring to fractions of **HBAR**, use the plural form **tinybars**. For example:

* "I will transfer 1,000 **tinybars** from my account to yours"

Do not use the singular form of the noun, as any reference should be plural since one **HBAR** equals 100,000 **tinybars**
