# Use of web2 and web3

When documenting or referring to "web2" and "web3," it's important to maintain consistency. Both terms should be in lowercase. The only exception to this rule is when either term starts a sentence. In such cases, the initial letter should be capitalized. For example:&#x20;

* ❌ **Incorrect**: "web3 technologies are evolving rapidly."
* ✅ **Correct**: "Web3 represents a shift towards decentralization."
* ✅ **Correct**: "In the context of web2, user data is often controlled by centralized entities."
* ✅ **Correct**: "The principles of transparency and user empowerment are fundamental to the development of web3 platforms."
