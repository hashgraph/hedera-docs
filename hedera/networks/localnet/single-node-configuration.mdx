## Using Single Node Configuration

Single node configuration simulates the networkâ€™s functions on a smaller scale (single node), ideal for debugging, testing, and prototype development.

<Accordion title="Single Node Mode Requirements">
Ensure the **`VirtioFS`** file sharing implementation is enabled in the docker settings.

Ensure the following configurations are set at minimum in Docker **Settings** -> **Resources** and are available for use:

**CPUs:** 6

**Memory:** 8GB

**Swap:** 1 GB

**Disk Image Size:** 64 GB

Ensure the **`Allow the default Docker sockets to be used (requires password)`** is enabled in Docker **Settings -> Advanced**.

#### **Starting and Stopping Node**

Before launching the network commands, confirm that Docker is installed and open on your machine. To stop your local node, use the following `npm` or `docker` commands. Before proceeding with this operation, make sure to back up any manually created files in the working directory.

<Accordion title="npm commands">
```bash wrap
# npm command to start the local network and generate accounts in detached mode
npm run start -- -d

# npm command to stop
npm run stop

# npm command to restart node
npm run restart
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="docker commands">
```bash
# Docker command to start the local network. Does not generate accounts
docker compose up -d

# Docker command to stop services
docker compose stop

# Docker command to restart local network
docker compose restart

# Docker command to stop local network and remove containers
docker compose down
```
</Accordion>

Alternatively, run `docker compose down -v; git clean -xfd; git reset --hard` to stop the local node and reset it to its original state. The full list of available commands can be found [here](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-local-node?tab=readme-ov-file#commands).
