## Overview

The **Smart Contracts endpoints** in the Hedera Mirror Node REST API allows developers to query **smart contract metadata, execution results, state changes, and logs**. These endpoints are essential for tracking contract interactions, retrieving transaction results, and debugging contract executions on the Hedera network.

## Endpoints

The following endpoints are available for the Smart Contracts object:

| **Endpoint**                                                  | **Description**                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/v1/contracts`                                       | Retrieves a list of smart contract entities on the network.         |
| `GET /api/v1/contracts/{contractIdOrAddress}`                 | Fetches details of a specific contract by ID.                       |
| `GET /api/v1/contracts/results/{transactionIdOrhash}`         | Retrieves execution results for a specific contract transaction ID. |
| `GET /api/v1/contracts/{contractIdOrAddress}/results`         | Retrieves execution results for a specific contract.                |
| `GET /api/v1/contracts/{id}/state`                            | Fetches the state of a contract.                                    |
| `GET /api/v1/contracts/results`                               | Lists execution results for all contracts.                          |
| `GET /api/v1/contracts/results/{transactionIdOrHash}/results` | Get contract actions by transaction ID or transaction hash.         |
| `GET /api/v1/contracts/results/{timestamp}`                   | Retrieves execution results for a contract at a given timestamp.    |
| `GET /api/v1/contracts/logs`                                  | Lists logs emitted from contracts.                                  |
| `GET /api/v1/contracts/{id}/results/logs`                     | Fetches logs for a specific contract.                               |
| `GET /api/v1/contracts/{id}/results/opcodes`                  | Get the opcode traces for historical transactions                   |
| `POST /api/v1/contracts/call`                                 | Invokes a smart contract method.                                    |
