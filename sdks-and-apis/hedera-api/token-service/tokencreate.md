# TokenCreate

Create a new token. After the token is created, the Token ID for it is in the receipt.

The specified Treasury Account is receiving the initial supply of tokens as-well as the tokens from the Token Mint operation once executed. The balance of the treasury account is decreased when the Token Burn operation is executed.

The `initialSupply` is the initial supply of the smallest parts of tokens (like a tinybar, not an hbar).The supply that is going to be put in circulation is going to be the initial supply provided.

The supply can change over time. If the total supply at some moment is `S` parts of tokens, and the token is using `D` decimals, then `S` must be less than or equal to `2^63-1`, which is `9,223,372,036,854,775,807`. The number of whole tokens (not parts) will `S / 10^D`.\
\
If `decimals` is 8 or 11, then the number of whole tokens can be at most a few billions or millions, respectively. For example, it could match Bitcoin (21 million whole tokens with 8 decimals) or hbars (50 billion whole tokens with 8 decimals). It could even match Bitcoin with milli-satoshis (21 million whole tokens with 11 decimals). (ed

Example:

Token A has an initial supply set to 10\_000 and decimals set to 2. The tokens that will be put into circulation are going be 100.

Token B has an initial supply set to 10\_012\_345\_678 and decimals set to 8. The number of tokens that will be put into circulation are going to be 100.12345678

Creating immutable token: Token can be created as immutable if the adminKey is omitted. In this case, the name, symbol, treasury, management keys, expiry and renew properties cannot be updated. If a token is created as immutable, anyone is able to extend the expiry time by paying the fee.
