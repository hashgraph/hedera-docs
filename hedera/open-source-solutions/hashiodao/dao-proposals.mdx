title: "DAO Proposals"
---


To create a proposal on chain, you must have sufficient voting power. This information can be found on the DAO's **Overview** tab from the [HashioDAO](https://hashiodao.swirldslabs.com/) dashboard.

<Info>
**Note**: There are no snapshots, like Ethereum-based DAOs, instead, your tokens are locked up for the duration of the vote. Your voting power is equal to the amount of tokens you lock up.
</Info>

Click on **Manage** and lock up tokens to increase your voting powers.
