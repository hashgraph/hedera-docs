#### **A Quick Note on Usage**

This organization is designed to educate, inspire, and help you get hands-on with Hedera. The repositories and code you'll discover are there to help you learn and see what’s possible. They aren't production-ready applications and shouldn't be used as direct dependencies in your live projects.

Everything here is maintained by the Developer Relations team to support your learning journey and showcase what’s possible with the network.
