title: "Get account token balance"
---


To get the balance of tokens for an account, you can submit an account balance query. The account balance query will return the tokens the account holds in a list format.

<Note>
#### **Recommend Using Mirror Node REST API**

For obtaining token information and historical data, consider using the Mirror Node REST API endpoint [**Get Token Account Balance**](https://docs.hedera.com/api-reference/tokens/list-token-balances) which offers several advantages:

* **Cost-effective and scalable:** [Mirror node providers](/hedera/core-concepts/mirror-nodes/hedera-mirror-node#mainnet) offer paid plans with a large number of queries included. The Hedera-hosted mirror node offers free queries with specific throttles for testing. While some SDK queries are currently free, these are subject to change in the future.
* **Performance:** Mirror nodes don't burden consensus nodes, allowing them to focus on processing transactions and providing efficient access to historical data without impacting network performance.
* **Historical data:** Mirror nodes store complete transaction history, records, and events - ideal for analytics, auditing, and monitoring past activity.
</Note>

**Query Fees**

* Please see the transaction and query [fees](/hedera/networks/mainnet/fees#transaction-and-query-fees) table for the base transaction fee
* Please use the [Hedera fee estimator](https://hedera.com/fees) to estimate your query fee cost

```java Java
//Create the query
AccountBalanceQuery query = new AccountBalanceQuery()
    .setAccountId(accountId);

//Sign with the operator private key and submit to a Hedera network
AccountBalance tokenBalance = query.execute(client);

System.out.println("The token balance(s) for this account: " +tokenBalance.tokens);

//v2.0.9
```


```javascript JavaScript
//Create the query
const query = new AccountBalanceQuery()
    .setAccountId(accountId);

//Sign with the client operator private key and submit to a Hedera network
const tokenBalance = await query.execute(client);

console.log("The token balance(s) for this account: " +tokenBalance.tokens.toString());

//v2.0.7
```


```go Go
//Create the query
query := hedera.NewAccountBalanceQuery().
	 SetAccountID(accountId)
	
//Sign with the client operator private key and submit to a Hedera network
tokenBalance, err := query.Execute(client)

if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

fmt.Printf("The token balance(s) for this account: %v\n", tokenBalance)

//v2.1.0
```


```rust Rust
// Create the query
let query = AccountBalanceQuery::new()
    .account_id(account_id);

// Sign with the client operator private key and submit to a Hedera network
let token_balance = query.execute(&client).await?;

println!("The token balance(s) for this account: {:?}", token_balance.tokens);

// v0.34.0
