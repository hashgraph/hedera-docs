How to configure a JSON-RPC endpoint that enables communication between
EVM-compatible developer tools using Hashio

[Hashio](https://www.hashgraph.com/hashio/)
is a public RPC endpoint hosted by Swirlds Labs. As a *public* endpoint, it:

* Is free to use
* Does not have any sign-up requirements
* Has significantly restrictive rate limits

While this combination may be considered less reliable, it offers the highest levels of ease of use among RPC
endpoints.

To connect to the Hedera networks via Hashio, simply use this URL when initializing the wallet or web3 provider
instance:

<CodeGroup>
</CodeGroup>


**Please note**: Hashio is
For development and testing purposes only. Production use cases are strongly encouraged to use [commercial-grade JSON-RPC relays](/hedera/core-concepts/smart-contracts/json-rpc-relay#community-hosted-json-rpc-relays) or host their own instance of the [Hedera JSON-RPC Relay](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-json-rpc-relay?tab=readme-ov-file#hedera-json-rpc-relay).

No further settings or configurations are needed!
