# Delete a smart contract

A transaction that deletes a smart contract from a Hedera network. Once a smart contract is marked deleted, you will not be able to modify any of the contract's properties. \*\*\*\* If a smart contract did not have an admin key defined, you cannot delete the smart contract. You can verify the smart contract was deleted by submitting a smart contract info query to the network. If a smart contract has an associated hbar balance, you will need to transfer the balance to another Hedera account.

**Transaction Signing Requirements**

* If the admin key was defined for the smart contract it is required to sign the transaction.
* The client operator's (fee payer account) private key is required to sign the transaction.

**Transaction Fees**

* Please see the transaction and query [NextCall a smart contract function](https://app.gitbook.com/s/3UlLhrwSBZKwLvX6vlUX/docs/sdks/smart-contracts/call-a-smart-contract-function) table for base transaction fee
* Please use the [Hedera fee estimator](https://hedera.com/fees) to estimate your transaction fee cost
