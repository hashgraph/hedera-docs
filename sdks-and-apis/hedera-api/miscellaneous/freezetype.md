| Enum                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `UNKNOWN_FREEZE_TYPE` | An (invalid) default value for this enum, to ensure the client explicitly sets the intended type of freeze transaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `FREEZE_ONLY`         | Freezes the network at the specified time. The start\_time field must be provided and must reference a future time. Any values specified for the update\_file and file\_hash fields will be ignored. This transaction does not perform any network changes or upgrades and requires manual intervention to restart the network. |
| `PREPARE_UPGRADE`     | A non-freezing operation that initiates network wide preparation in advance of a scheduled freeze upgrade. The update\_file and file\_hash fields must be provided and valid. The start\_time field may be omitted and any value present will be ignored.                                                                       |
| `FREEZE_UPGRADE`      | Freezes the network at the specified time and performs the previously prepared automatic upgrade across the entire network.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `FREEZE_ABORT`        | Aborts a pending network freeze operation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `TELEMETRY_UPGRADE`   | Performs an immediate upgrade on auxilary services and containers providing telemetry/metrics. Does not impact network operations.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
