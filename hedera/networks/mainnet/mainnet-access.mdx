To interact with and access the various Hedera Mainnet services such as accounts, topics, tokens, files, and smart contracts, you will need a Hedera account. Your Hedera account also holds a balance of HBAR, which can be used to make transaction fee payments or transfers to other accounts.

| ✅ Private Key Viewable      | You have access to the private key associated with the mainnet account the wallet created for you                                                       |
| ✅ SDK-compatible Passphrase | The passphrase created by the wallet is compatible with the SDKs and can be used to recover the private keys for the account the wallet created for you |

### Create new mainnet accounts

Once you have obtained your mainnet account from a supported wallet, you can use the SDKs to create additional mainnet accounts.

To do this, you will need to point your Hedera client to mainnet (`Client.forMainnet()`)and use the `AccountCreateTransaction` API to create a new account. The transaction fee payer (referred to as the `operator` in the SDKs) information should be set to the mainnet account you created from one of the above wallets (`setOperator(<mainnetAccountId, mainnetAccountPrivateKey)`).
