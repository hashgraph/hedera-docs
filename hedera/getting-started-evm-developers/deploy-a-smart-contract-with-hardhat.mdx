## Deploying a Contract Using Hardhat Scripts

This tutorial will walk you through writing and compiling an ERC-721 Solidity smart contract. You'll then deploy and interact with it on the Hedera network using the [Hedera Smart Contract Service (HSCS)](/hedera/support-and-community/glossary#hedera-smart-contract-service-hscs) and familiar EVM tools like Ethers.js, connecting via the [JSON-RPC relay](/hedera/core-concepts/smart-contracts/json-rpc-relay).

#### What you will accomplish

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Compile and deploy a smart contract using Hardhat
- Interact with a smart contract using Hardhat

---

## Step 1: Project Setup

#### Initialize Project

Set up your project by initializing the hardhat project:

```bash
mkdir hardhat-erc-721-mint
cd hardhat-erc-721-mint
npx hardhat --init
```

Make sure to select "**Hardhat 3 â†’ Typescript Hardhat Project using Mocha and Ethers.js"** and accept the default values. Hardhat will configure your project correctly and install the required dependencies.

<Accordion title="ðŸš§ What's new: Hardhat 2 â†’ 3 ">
Key differences in Hardhat 3:

- **compile â†’ build**\
  `npx hardhat compile` is now `npx hardhat build`. This is the big one. The v3 migration guide explicitly shows using the `build` task.
- **project init switch**\
  v2 commonly used `npx hardhat` or `npx hardhat init` to bootstrap. In v3 itâ€™s `npx hardhat --init`.

* **keystore helper commands are new**\
  v3â€™s recommended flow includes a keystore plugin with commands like `npx hardhat keystore set HEDERA_RPC_URL` and `npx hardhat keystore set HEDERA_PRIVATE_KEY`. These werenâ€™t standard in v2.
* **Foundry-compatiable Solidity tests**\
  In addition to offering Javascript/Typescript integration tests, Hardhat v3 also integrates Foundry-compatible Solidity tests that allows developers to write unit tests directly in Solidity

- **Enhanced Network Management**\
  v3 allows tasks to create and manage multiple network connections simultaneously which is a significant improvement over the single, fixed connection available in version 2. This provides greater flexibility for scripts and tests that interact with multiple networks.

</Accordion>

#### Install Dependencies

Next, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```

Before we make any changes to our Hardhat configuration file, let's set some configuration variables we will be referring to within the file later.

```bash
# If you have already set this before, please use the --force flag
npx hardhat keystore set HEDERA_RPC_URL
```

For `HEDERA_RPC_URL`, we'll have `https://testnet.hashio.io/api`

```bash
# If you have already set this before, please use the --force flag
npx hardhat keystore set HEDERA_PRIVATE_KEY
```

For `HEDERA_PRIVATE_KEY`, enter the **HEX Encoded Private Key for your ECDSA account** from the [Hedera Portal.](https://portal.hedera.com/)

<Danger>
#### Note

[_Hashio_](https://www.hashgraph.com/hashio/) _is intended for development and testing purposes only. For production use cases, it's recommended to use commercial-grade JSON-RPC Relay or host your own instance of the_ [_Hiero JSON-RPC Relay_](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-json-rpc-relay)_._

</Danger>

#### Configure Hardhat

Update your `hardhat.config.ts` file in the root directory of your project. This file contains the network settings so Hardhat knows how to interact with the Hedera Testnet. We'll use the variables you've stored in your `.env` file.

```typescript hardhat.config.ts
import type { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";

import hardhatToolboxMochaEthersPlugin from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox-mocha-ethers";
import { configVariable } from "hardhat/config";

const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  plugins: [hardhatToolboxMochaEthersPlugin],
  solidity: {
    profiles: {
      default: {
        version: "0.8.28",
      },
      production: {
        version: "0.8.28",
        settings: {
          optimizer: {
            enabled: true,
            runs: 200,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  networks: {
    testnet: {
      type: "http",
      url: configVariable("HEDERA_RPC_URL"),
      accounts: [configVariable("HEDERA_PRIVATE_KEY")],
    },
  },
};

export default config;
```

You can verify the connection by running:

```bash
npx hardhat console --network testnet
```

This command launches an interactive JavaScript console connected directly to the Hedera testnet, providing access to the [Ethers.js library](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/) for blockchain interactions. If you successfully enter this interactive environment, your Hardhat configuration is correct. To exit the interactive console, press `ctrl + c` twice.

We won't be using `ignition` and we will be removing the default contracts that come with the Hardhat default project, so we will remove all the unnecessary directories and files first:

```bash
rm -rf contracts/* scripts/* test/*
rm -rf ignition
```

---

## Step 2: Creating the ERC-721 Contract

Create a new Solidity file (`MyToken.sol`) in our `contracts` directory:

```solidity contracts/MyToken.sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
// Compatible with OpenZeppelin Contracts ^5.0.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

import {ERC721} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import {Ownable} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC721, Ownable {
    uint256 private _nextTokenId;

    constructor(address initialOwner)
        ERC721("MyToken", "MTK")
        Ownable(initialOwner)
    {}

    function safeMint(address to) public onlyOwner returns (uint256) {
        uint256 tokenId = _nextTokenId++;
        _safeMint(to, tokenId);
        return tokenId;
    }
}
```

This contract was created using the [OpenZeppelin Contracts Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/#erc721) and OpenZeppelin's ERC-721 standard implementation with an ownership model. The ERC-721 token's name has been set to "MyToken." The contract implements the `safeMint` function, which accepts the address of the owner of the new token and uses auto-increment IDs, starting from 0.

Let's compile this contract by running:

```bash
npx hardhat build
```

This command will generate the smart contract artifacts, including the [ABI](/hedera/core-concepts/smart-contracts/compiling-smart-contracts). We are now ready to deploy the smart contract.

---

## Step 3: Deploy Your ERC-721 Smart Contract

Create a deployment script (`deploy.ts`) in `scripts` directory:

```typescript scripts/deploy.ts
import { network } from "hardhat";

const { ethers } = await network.connect({
  network: "testnet",
});

async function main() {
  // Get the signer of the tx and address for minting the token
  const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
  console.log("Deploying contract with the account:", deployer.address);

  // The deployer will also be the owner of our NFT contract
  const MyToken = await ethers.getContractFactory("MyToken", deployer);
  const contract = await MyToken.deploy(deployer.address);

  await contract.waitForDeployment();

  const address = await contract.getAddress();
  console.log("Contract deployed at:", address);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

In this script, we first retrieve your account (the deployer) using Ethers.js. This account will own the deployed smart contract. Next, we use this account to deploy the contract by calling `MyToken.deploy(deployer.address)`. This passes your account address as the initial owner and signer of the deployment transaction.

Deploy your contract by executing the script:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network testnet
```

<Check>Copy the deployed addressâ€”you'll need this in subsequent steps.</Check>

The output looks like this:

```bash
~/projects/hardhat-erc-721-mint-burn >> npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network testnet
Compiling your Solidity contracts...
Compiled 1 Solidity file with solc 0.8.28 (evm target: cancun)

Contract deployed at: 0x6035bA3BCa9595637B463Aa514c3a1cE3f67f3de
```

---

## Step 4: Minting an ERC-721 Token

Create a `mint.ts` script in your `scripts` directory to mint an NFT. Don't forget to replace the `<your-contract-address>` with the address you've just copied.

```typescript scripts/mint.ts
import { network } from "hardhat";

const { ethers } = await network.connect({
  network: "testnet",
});

async function main() {
  const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();

  // Get the ContractFactory of your MyToken ERC-721 contract
  const MyToken = await ethers.getContractFactory("MyToken", deployer);

  // Connect to the deployed contract
  // (REPLACE WITH YOUR CONTRACT ADDRESS)
  const contractAddress = "<your-contract-address>";
  const contract = MyToken.attach(contractAddress);

  // Mint a token to ourselves
  const mintTx = await contract.safeMint(deployer.address);
  const receipt = await mintTx.wait();
  console.log("receipt: ", JSON.stringify(receipt, null, 2));
  const mintedTokenId = receipt?.logs[0].topics[3];
  console.log("Minted token ID:", mintedTokenId);

  // Check the balance of the token
  const balance = await contract.balanceOf(deployer.address);
  console.log("Balance:", balance.toString(), "NFTs");
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

The code mints a new NFT to your account ( `deployer.address` ). Then we verify the balance to see if we own an ERC-721 token of type `MyToken`.

**Mint an NFT:**

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/mint.ts --network testnet
```

**Expected output:**

```json wrap
~/projects/hardhat-erc-721-mint-burn >> npx hardhat run scripts/mint.ts --network testnet
