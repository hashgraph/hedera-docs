## Release Highlights

Release v0.67 enhances the stability and performance of the Hiero Consensus Node and updates. Continued progress was made on [HIP-1081](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-1081) Block Nodes, adding features to improve connectivity and metrics.

<Accordion title="What's new in Release v0.67?" icon="sparkles">
  **Updates:**

  - **Improved Block Streaming Metrics:** Metrics for communication between consensus and block nodes have been reworked for clarity and utility. Metric names no longer include the self-node ID, as this is now automatically added as a label
  - **Block Streaming Service Lifecycle:** The startup and shutdown procedures for the `BlockBufferService` and `BlockNodeConnectionManager` have been improved to ensure more reliable initialization and termination.
  - **Enhanced Testing and CI**: A large effort was invested in improving the test infrastructure, including adding test container support for block nodes, increasing test coverage for block node communication, and parallelizing test suite runs to accelerate the development cycle.
  - **Besu Upgrade**: Upgraded Besu EVM to 25.2.2. The update introduces Besu Native Libraries Verification, which ensures that required native libraries are available on the host operating system. When these libraries are missing, Besu falls back to non-native implementations, which can reduce performance. This verification helps maintain optimal execution efficiency and consistency across nodes.

  **Summary:**

  Steady strides were also made in Block Node stability and manageability, including optimizations for error handling, and operational monitoring. The new Besu upgrade brings EVM to v.25.2.2 with Besu Native Libraries Verification enhancements.

  For developers, no breaking changes or immediate actions required. Existing contracts and integrations remain fully compatible.

### Release Highlights

With the introduction of batch transactions, Release v0.66 marks a key milestone in enhancing flexibility and certainty when executing complex use cases.

<Accordion title="What's new in Release v0.66?">
  #### Batch Transaction Processing ([HIP-551](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-improvement-proposals/blob/main/HIP/hip-551.md))

  Historically, Hiero developers have been limited to submitting and processing transactions individually. To create complex flows developers relied on smart contracts to execute the series of transactions and mirror node queries to monitor the status of submitted transactions, leading to increased latency, added code complexity, and greater risk of partial failures or errors.

  Release v0.66 introduces [HIP-551](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-improvement-proposals/blob/main/HIP/hip-551.md) - Batch Transactions, allowing multiple transactions to be bundled and submitted as a single unit that guarantees ACID properties (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability). The network handles the batch atomically, ensuring consistent execution while providing granular receipts for each inner transaction. This new feature unlocks capabilities like streamlined dApp interactions, atomic multi-step operations, and consolidation of multiple transactions into one HAPI call.

  **Key benefits:**

  - **Efficiency Gains**: Increases efficiency by processing multiple transactions in one submission, ideal for high-volume applications like DeFi or NFTs.
  - **Developer Flexibility**: Enables new use cases, such as batch token minting or multi-account updates, without requiring smart contracts.
  - **User Experience Improvements**: Simplifies interactions for end-users, e.g., executing a series of approvals and transfers in a single step.

  To support this, no major client code changes are needed for basic usage, but developers should update to SDKs that support this feature.

  **SDK Versions Supporting Batch Transactions**

  Below are the versions of SDKs that support batch transactions:

  | SDK                                                        | Version  |
  | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
  | [Java](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-java)     | v2.55.0+ |
  | [JavaScript](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-js) | v2.64.0+ |
  | [Go](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-go)         | v2.61.0+ |
  | [Rust](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-rust)     | v0.39.0+ |
  | [C++](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-cpp)       | v0.40.0+ |

  <Info>
    **NOTE**: Batches may fail partially if inner transactions violate rules; always check individual receipts. For full details on batch structure and rules, see[
    HIP-551](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-improvement-proposals/blob/main/HIP/hip-551.md).
  </Info>
  #### Advancements in Block Node Communication

  The development of Block Nodes ([HIP-1081](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-improvement-proposals/blob/main/HIP/hip-1081.md)) continues with this release, with the following development being done:

  **State Export Tools**: New commands and improvements for exporting states (Issue: [#20622](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-consensus-node/pull/20622)). This is a part of enabling block nodes to improve state snapshotting.

  **Block Node Communication**: Enhancements to the communication protocol between consensus nodes and block nodes. Provides better recovery and shutdown procedures to minimize downtime during events like freezes. (Issues: [#20858](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-consensus-node/pull/20858), [#20874](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-consensus-node/pull/20874))\\

  **MAINNET UPDATE: SEPTEMBER 24, 2025**
</Check>

<Check>
  **TESTNET UPDATE: SEPTEMBER 4, 2025**
</Check>

### Release Highlights

Release v0.65 highlights include Virtual Mega Map, enforcement of `max_custom_fees` for [HIP-991 ](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-991)scheduled transactions, and Block Stream improvements including forward-compatibility and unified transaction records. Together, these changes introduce powerful new state management capabilities, scheduled transaction fee controls, and continued advancements toward production-ready Block Streams.

<Accordion title="What's new in Release 0.65?">
  #### Virtual Mega Map

  The Virtual Mega Map enhances Hedera's internal state data structure by consolidating all entities—including singletons, queues, and maps—into a single virtual map. This ensures the entire state rolls up to one root hash.

  **Key benefit:**

  - Enhanced Verifiability: A unified root hash simplifies state and block item proofs, used for block streams.

  #### HIP-991 Enhancements: max_custom_fees for Scheduled Transactions

  Release v0.65 adds support for max_custom_fees in scheduled transactions with HIP-991 topics.

  **Key benefits:**

  - Predictable Fees: Ensures maximum custom fee limits are enforced.
  - Alignment with HTS: Extends scheduled transaction functionality to better match Hedera Token Service features.
  - Developer Guardrails: Protects applications and users from unexpected fee outcomes.

  #### **Advancements in HIP-1056 & HIP-1127: Block Streams**

  Building on the Block Stream work from v0.64, this release delivers major steps toward a unified, verifiable stream layer.

  **New developments:**

  [HIP-1127](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-1127): Unified Transaction Record in Block Stream: Addresses historical duplication in how transactions are represented and creates a single, unified standard for the block stream. It achieves this while ensuring complete backward compatibility for existing applications, requiring no code changes for developers submitting transactions.

  **Key benefits:**

  - Performance & Scalability: Improves throughput and reduces latency when handling accounts, tokens, and other stateful data.
  - Future-Proofing: Provides a foundation for ongoing state service optimization.
  - Reduces State: Reduces the size and cost of the data stream

## Release v0.64

<Check>
  **MAINNET UPDATE: AUGUST 20, 2025**
</Check>

<Check>
  **TESTNET UPDATE: AUGUST 7, 2025**
</Check>

### Release Highlights

Release v0.64 significantly improves the developer experience for frontend applications by introducing dynamic gRPC-Web endpoint discovery. This simplifies development workflows, enhances scalability, and sets the stage for a more decentralized and robust Hedera network. Additionally, this release includes important important block stream feature development, bug fixes, optimizations, and dependency updates that contribute to the overall stability and performance of the Hiero Consensus Node.

<Accordion title="What's new in Release 0.64?">
  #### **HIP-1046: gRPC-Web Proxy Endpoint Support To the Address Book**

  Historically, connecting frontend applications to Hedera using the JavaScript SDK has been challenging due to browser security restrictions. gRPC-Web was used as a workaround, but the necessary endpoints were hardcoded into the SDK. This approach required manual updates and coordination, which could become problematic as Hedera grows and more independent nodes operate.

  To address this issue, release v0.64.0 introduces dynamic endpoint discovery for gRPC-Web, as described in [HIP-1046](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-1046). The Hedera address book now includes gRPC-Web endpoint information, which the JavaScript SDK uses dynamically. This eliminates the need for hardcoded endpoints and simplifies connecting frontend applications to the Hedera network, even as endpoints change.

  **Key benefits:**

  - **Simplified Development**: Eliminates the need for manual SDK updates to reflect endpoint changes.
  - **Enhanced Scalability**: Supports the growing number of nodes on the Hedera network.
  - **Improved User Experience**: Provides a more seamless and robust connection experience for frontend applications.

  **Client code impact:**

  - Update to the latest Hedera JavaScript SDK to leverage this feature. The SDK will now automatically retrieve gRPC-Web endpoints from the address book.
  - Applications or tools that manually maintained lists of gRPC-Web endpoints should now query the mirror node for the latest list.

  #### **Advancements in HIP-1056: Block Streams**

  Version 0.64 introduces substantial progress on [HIP-1056](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-1056), which aims to create Block Streams—a unified, verifiable data stream that combines Hedera's existing event, record, and sidecar streams into a single efficient output. These enhancements focus on making Block Streams production-ready by prioritizing efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and security.

  Key developments in this release include:

  - **Stream Size Optimization:** The block stream has been refined to minimize its size, reducing storage and transmission costs while maintaining high performance and scalability. This release represents a partial update, with more enhancements to follow.
  - **Batch Transaction Support:** Added functionality to include batch transactions into the block stream.
  - **Consensus Node-to-Block Node Communication:** Established secure and reliable communication channels between consensus nodes and block nodes including features like acknowledgments and resend mechanisms. This release represents a partial update, with more enhancements to follow.

  #### **Other updates:**

  In addition to the aforementioned features, release 0.64 introduces other updates:

  - Added TCK tests to the continuous integration pipeline ( #18727 ) to improve testing coverage and software quality.
  - Disallowed setting duplicate rosters ( #19072 ) to optimize storage and CPU usage.
  - Several dependency updates ( #18714, #18841, #19074 ) to leverage the latest improvements and security patches.

## Release v0.63

<Check>
  **MAINNET UPDATE: JULY 23, 2025**
</Check>

<Check>
  **TESTNET UPDATE: JULY 10, 2025**
</Check>

### Release Highlights

Release v0.63 introduces three focused improvements: birth-round based ancient event handling, low overhead SDK usage metrics, and full support for non-zero realm IDs.

<Accordion title="What's new in Release 0.63?">
  **Birth-Round Migration**

  Today ancient event pruning correlates with clock time rather than specifically from consensus rounds causing overhead during node updates. In this release birth-rounds are based on consensus time which causes more consistent pruning and smoother node joins, exits, and upgrades.

  **SDK Usage Metrics & gRPC Call insights**

  Release .63 introduces a gRPC interceptor that aggregates methods into `gRPC_usage` metrics every 15m. This will give node and network operators granular visibility with minimal overhead.

  **Non-Zero Realm Support**

  Shard and realm default values on Hiero have previously assumed 0 values, sometimes with hardcoded logic limiting our ability to test future multi value shard and realm network implementations. All APIs and services now accept arbitrary shard and realm IDs. Moving forward we can consistently test future network upgrades in a way that validates non zero realm and shard network configurations.

  #### Summary

  Release 0.63 aligns ancient event handling with consensus time, adds actionable higher resolution SDK telemetry, and removes limitations to implementing non zero realm and shard value tests. This improves Hiero network operational robustness, and expands test configurations.

## Release v0.62

<Check>
  **MAINNET UPDATE: JUNE 25, 2025**
</Check>

<Check>
  **TESTNET UPDATE: JUNE 3, 2025**
</Check>

### Release Highlights

Release 0.62 delivers substantial improvements in Ethereum compatibility, continuing Hedera’s commitment to providing a seamless and cost-effective experience for developers and ecosystem participants building with Ethereum tools and infrastructure. In addition, this release updates the HIP-991 SubmitMessage fees and lays the groundwork for block streams. What's new in Release 0.62?

#### **Jumbo Ethereum Transaction Support (**[**HIP-1086**](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-1086)**)**

Historically, the Hedera API (HAPI) transaction size has been limited to 6 KB. Many Ethereum smart contracts and certain Ethereum contract calls exceed this limit. To work around this, developers previously had to utilize Hedera’s file service to upload larger contracts or call data in multiple 6 KB chunks — a process that added complexity, cost, and latency. Release 0.62 eliminates this friction by supporting a significantly larger transaction size of almost 128 KB for smart contract transactions, thereby simplifying EVM developer workflows and improving performance.

**Key benefits:**

- Simplified development: Eliminates the need to write and maintain custom code to handle 6 KB chunking.
- Reduced cost and latency: Streamlines common operations such as ContractCreate, ContractCall, and `EthereumTransaction`.
- Improved cost efficiency for JSON-RPC relays: Lowers operational costs for relay providers.
- Enhanced Ethereum compatibility: Brings the experience of creating and calling smart contracts on Hedera closer to native Ethereum workflows.

To support this capability, the release also introduces a reworked throttling system that protects against potential denial-of-service (DoS) attacks while maintaining fairness across transaction sizes.

#### **Zero-Cost EthereumTransaction on Success (**[**HIP-1084**](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-1084)**)**

A frequently reported pain point from JSON-RPC relay operators has been the cost of submitting wrapper EthereumTransactions. While gas costs for contract execution are typically borne by the calling entity (EOA or contract), relay operators have been required to fund the HBAR-based transaction fee — resulting in reduced adoption and ecosystem participation. Release 0.62 addresses this by eliminating the cover charge for EthereumTransactions where the inner call completes and pays for the gas consumed.

#### **Key benefits:**

- Simplified relay operation: Removes the need for relay operators or embedded relays in dApps to maintain funded HBAR accounts for successful calls.
- Enhanced Ethereum compatibility: Further enhances Hedera’s Ethereum compatibility by charging all costs in gas alone.
- Better ecosystem support: Encourages greater participation by third-party relay operators and dApp developers.

To maintain network security, malformed, underfunded, or invalid contract calls that fail to cover gas fees through regular mechanisms will still be charged a fee in order to prevent abuse.

#### Other updates:

In addition to the aforementioned features that improve Ethereum compatibility, Release 0.62 introduces two other updates:

- SubmitMessage API calls for an HCS topic with Custom Fees ([HIP-991](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-991)) have been updated to \$0.05 for the Hedera network.
- Foundational improvements in block stream management and handling workflows that will enable future features in block streaming capabilities and performance in upcoming releases.

#### **Summary:**

Release 0.62 represents an important milestone toward making Hedera a highly competitive platform for Ethereum-compatible applications, completes the implementation of HIP-991, and sets up the foundation for streaming the network blocks and state information.

### Release Highlights

This release focuses on enhancing network incentivization and improving overall system robustness and developer experience.

#### Hiero Improvement Proposals (HIPs)

- **Daily rewards for active nodes** [HIP-1064](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-improvement-proposals/issues/1064): Full implementation of a daily reward mechanism for active consensus nodes, including an option for node operators to decline these rewards. This enhances network health by incentivizing consistent node uptime and participation, while providing operators flexibility in managing their rewards and improving network decentralization. Please note this feature will be disabled until a July 1, 2025 launch date.
- **HIP-551 (Atomic Batch Transactions)**: [HIP-551](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/551) This release includes the implementation of Atomic Batch Transactions; however, due to technical challenges identified in testing, this feature has been temporarily disabled.

  As a result, users attempting to submit Atomic Batch Transactions will receive a status code of `BUSY` from the network. We are actively working to resolve these issues and plan to enable this feature in a future update.

#### New Features

- **Node Reward Opt-Out (HIP-1064)**: Node operators can now decline daily node rewards using a new decline_reward boolean flag in NodeCreateTransactionBody and NodeUpdateTransactionBody. This offers greater control and flexibility for node operators based on their specific requirements. The default value for this flag will be set to true to decline rewards by default.
  - ```
    // Example: Opting out of node rewards during node creation
    NodeCreateTransactionBody createBody = NodeCreateTransactionBody.newBuilder()
        // ... other fields like accountID, description, etc.
        .setDeclineReward(true) // Set to true to decline node rewards
        .build();
    ```

#### Notable Bug Fixes

- [**#17478**](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-consensus-node/issues/17478)**: Corrected Cancun SELFDESTRUCT Semantics**: Fixed incorrect `SELFDESTRUCT` behavior per [EIP-6780](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6780) post-Cancun, where a contract specifying itself as the beneficiary in a non-creation transaction erroneously triggered a `SELF_DESTRUCT_TO_SELF` error. The fix ensures compliance with [EIP-6780](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6780), allowing the operation to proceed without deleting the contract or transferring its balance, including native tokens. Additionally, refactored CustomSelfDestructOperation.execute to streamline validation checks before state changes. Impact: Enhances EVM compatibility and reliability on Hedera for contracts using `SELFDESTRUCT`, ensuring correct execution under post-Cancun rules.

### Release Highlights

#### HIPs:

#### [HIP-991](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-991): Topic Fees

- Description: ​HIP-991 introduces an optional fee system for submitting messages to topics on the Hedera network, aiming to enhance economic scalability and simplify operations for topic operators.
- Benefits: Empowers topic operators with greater control over their topics, offering mechanisms to monetize and manage access. Key features include:
  - Optional Submission Fees: Topic operators can set optional fees for message submissions, payable in HBAR or Hedera Token Service (HTS) fungible tokens.​
  - Fee Schedule Key: A new 'Fee Schedule Key' allows operators to manage and update fee structures. This key must be set during topic creation.​
  - Custom Fee Distribution: Collected fees can be distributed to multiple accounts, supporting both HBAR and HTS tokens.​
  - Fee Exemptions: Operators can specify a list of keys that are exempt from fees, allowing certain users to submit messages without incurring charges.​

#### [HIP-755](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-755): Schedule Service System Contract signSchedule(address, bytes)

- Description: This HIP introduces a Schedule Service System Contract to enhance the Hedera Smart Contract Service (HSCS) by enabling smart contracts to interact with scheduled transactions. This release includes signSchedule(address, bytes).
- Benefits: HIP-755 introduces a Schedule Service System Contract to enhance the Hedera Smart Contract Service by enabling smart contracts to interact with scheduled transactions. signSchedule(address, bytes) method, allows smart contracts to pass along the signature from an EOA needed for a scheduled transaction.

#### [HIP-756](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-756): Scheduled Token Create/Update Transactions via Smart Contract

- Description: Enables scheduling token create and update operations through smart contracts, with implementation of the scheduleNative system contract function.
- Benefits: Expands smart contract functionality by allowing developers to schedule token operations directly from smart contracts, providing more flexibility in DApp development.

<Check>
  **TESTNET UPDATE: FEBRUARY 11, 2025**
</Check>

### Release Highlights

This release introduces several new features, improvements, and bug fixes, including:

#### HIPs

- **HIP-423 Long-Term Scheduled Transactions**: Update to ScheduleSign throttles changed: The ScheduleSign transaction is now throttled like other transactions and can now be managed by the default throttling mechanism on the network. ([#16958](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/issues/16958), [#16959](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/issues/16959)) This completes HIP-423.
- **HIP-755 authorizeSchedule(address)**\
  Adds functionality to the Hedera Schedule Service System contract so that a smart contract can sign a referenced scheduled transaction using its contract key, enabling automated execution of scheduled transactions directly from smart contracts. ([#16983](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-consensus-node/pull/16983)), the remaining outstanding features to complete HIP-755 will be provisioned in release .59.

#### Other Notable Changes

- Enabled mirror node to simulate contract calls: The standalone transaction executor now supports custom Operations. Developers can use this feature to create and execute custom operations that are not part of the standard Hedera API. ([#17354](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/issues/17354))
- **Enhancing Dynamic Address Book v2** NodeCreate and NodeDelete transaction signature requirements changed:
  - The NodeCreate transaction now requires the admin key and one of the treasury account key, system admin key, or address book admin key to sign.
    - The NodeDelete transaction is now a non-privileged transaction and requires one of the admin key, treasury account key, system admin key, or address book admin key to sign. ([#16900](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/issues/16900), [#17021](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/issues/17021), [#16990](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/issues/16990), [#17029](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/issues/17029))
- **Ensuring state changes are now in block streams**: Refactored out-of-band state modifications: All out-of-band state modifications have been refactored to be done in Schemas. ([#16843](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/issues/16843))
- Increased CryptoGetAccountBalance throttle: The throttle for the CryptoGetAccountBalance query has been increased to the number of network nodes times 1,000,000 plus a buffer. This change addresses an issue where the throttle was too low, leading to throttling errors.

  **TESTNET UPDATE: JANUARY 8, 2025**
</Check>

### Release Highlights

This release introduces several new features, improvements, and bug fixes, including:

#### HIPs

- **HIP-423: Long-Term Scheduled Transactions:** This release completes the implementation of [HIP-423](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-423), enabling schedules to execute transactions at a future date and time. This provides developers with a powerful tool for automating on-chain actions and building time-based applications. Benefits include:
  - **Automated Transactions:** Schedule transactions to execute automatically at a specific time.
  - **Time-Based Applications:** Build applications that rely on time-based events, such as recurring payments or token distributions.
  - **Enhanced Security:** Schedule transactions can be signed by multiple parties, ensuring that they are executed only when all required approvals are obtained.

#### New Features

- **Node Operator Queries:** This release introduces a dedicated gRPC port for node operators to perform free queries. This enables node operators to monitor the network and their nodes more efficiently without incurring transaction fees.
- **Proxy Redirect Contract for Schedule Entities:** This release adds support for a proxy redirect contract for calls to schedule transactions. This allows EOAs to make function calls in schedule entity addresses, enabling more flexible and dynamic interactions with scheduled transactions.
- **HSS System Contract:** This release introduces the Hedera Schedule Service (HSS) system contract, providing a set of functions for managing scheduled transactions, including signing and authorizing schedules.
- **Support for Extra Dispatch Authorizations:** The `ScheduleSignHandler` now supports authorizing `Key{contractID=0.0.X}` and `Key{delegatable_contract_id=0.0.X}` keys in a schedule's signatories list, enabling more granular control over schedule execution.

### Release Highlights

#### HIPs

**HIP-869 Dynamic Address Book—Stage 1**: This release includes the implementation of HIP-869, enabling the Dynamic Address Book. Node operators can now update node details and address books via Hedera transactions. This streamlines network operations and enables node operators to manage their associated node entries directly in the Address Book.

**HIP-904 System Contract Functions**: Implements the System Contract Functions section within [HIP-904](http://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-904#system-contract-functions). Introduces Hedera Token Service (HTS) support for the airdrop-related capabilities. These functions are implemented as system contract functions, making it possible for smart contracts to issue Frictionless Airdrops, Token Reject, and AutomaticToken Association configurations for efficient management.

**`HIP-632 - isAuthorized()`**: The `isAuthorized()` function introduced in [HIP-632](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-632) extends the Hedera Account Service (HAS) System Contract, enabling smart contracts to authenticate signatures against Hedera accounts. This provides functionality akin to the validation step following Ethereum's `ECRECOVER`, without recovering public keys. It supports ECDSA, ED25519, and complex keys such as threshold keys, though ECDSA is recommended for compatibility and interoperability with Ethereum. This builds on the previous functionality of `isAuthorizedRaw()` released in 0.52.

**Other Notable Changes:**

**Block Streams - Dev Access Preview:** Block Streams is a new output stream that will replace Hedera’s existing event and record streams into a single stream of verifiable data. This consolidated approach not only simplifies data consumption but also enhances Hedera's capabilities by including state data.

Starting with version 0.56, consensus nodes will publish preview block stream files alongside the existing record stream, which remains the authoritative source of truth for Hedera. This preview allows the community to explore, test, and provide feedback on this new feature, paving the way for its future adoption.

**`Migration from .pfx to .pem Cryptography Files`**: The consensus node cryptography system was migrated from using `.pfx` files to more manageable `.pem` files.
