Check out the public [GitHub repo](https://github.com/hashgraph/asset-tokenization-studio) for the full source code. Alternatively, you can try out the[ interactive sandbox (demo)](https://tokenization-studio.hedera.com/) to explore the Asset Tokenization Studio (ATS) features.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is Asset Tokenization?">

Asset tokenization converts[ real-world assets (RWAs)](/hedera/support-and-community/glossary#real-world-asset-rwa) like real estate, equities, bonds, or commodities into [digital tokens](/hedera/support-and-community/glossary#digital-token) on a blockchain or other distributed ledger technology (DLT). This allows for [fractional ownership](/hedera/support-and-community/glossary#fractional-ownership), greater liquidity, and easier transferability, making these assets accessible to a wider range of investors.

<Accordion title="What is the Difference Between a Security Token and a Digital Security?">

A [security token](/hedera/support-and-community/glossary#security-token) represents ownership in a real-world asset and must comply with securities regulations. It often offers benefits like dividends or voting rights. [Digital security](/hedera/support-and-community/glossary#security-token) is a broader term referring to the digital form of any security, regardless of whether it's on a blockchain. It encompasses all forms of digital representations of securities, including those on traditional databases, not just those issued as tokens on a distributed ledger technology (DLT).

<Accordion title="What is Asset Tokenization Studio?">

[Asset Tokenization Studio (ATS)](/hedera/open-source-solutions/asset-tokenization-studio-ats/..#how-asset-tokenization-studio-ats-works) is Hedera's open-source solution designed to simplify creating, managing, and operating tokenized assets.

<Accordion title="How Does the Tokenization Process Work?">

In ATS, tokenization involves defining the asset's characteristics, setting up compliance rules, and generating digital securities on the Hedera network. Once created, these tokens can be issued and traded on the blockchain or other forms of distributed ledgers, with ATS managing the entire lifecycle.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are the Smart Contracts Used by Asset Tokenization Studio Secure?">

Yes, the smart contracts used by Asset Tokenization Studio are audited by [A&D Forensics](https://adforensics.com.ng/audit-services/) to ensure their security and reliability.

When an update is needed, the proxy contract can point to a new logic contract (resolver) that defines the new rules or behaviors.
