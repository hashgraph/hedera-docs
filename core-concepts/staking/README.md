# Staking

The Hedera public ledger uses a [proof-of-stake](../../support-and-community/glossary.md#proof-of-stake-pos) consensus mechanism, in which each nodeâ€™s influence on consensus is proportional to the amount of cryptocurrency it has staked. A transaction is validated and placed into consensus after it is processed by nodes representing an aggregate stake of over two-thirds of the total amount of HBAR currently staked and dedicated to securing the network. Stake is expressed as an amount in HBAR. It is important to ensure that most of the cryptocurrency is actually being staked, so that the network continues to run. This information can be referenced from the latest Hedera [whitepaper](https://hedera.com/hh_whitepaper_v2.1-20200815.pdf).

## FAQ

<details>

<summary>What is staking in Hedera?</summary>

Staking is the process of participating in a [proof-of-stake](../../support-and-community/glossary.md#proof-of-stake-pos) system to validate transactions and earn rewards. When staked, coins are locked but can be unlocked for trading. Staking allows participants (stakeholders) to earn rewards on their holdings, typically in tokens or coins.
