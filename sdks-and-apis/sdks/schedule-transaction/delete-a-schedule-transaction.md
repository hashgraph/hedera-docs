# Delete a schedule transaction

A `ScheduleDeleteTransaction` is a consensus node transaction that removes a scheduled transaction from the network. A scheduled transaction can only be deleted if an admin key was set during its creation. If no admin key was set, any attempt to delete it will result in a `SCHEDULE_IS_IMMUTABLE` response from the network. Once successfully deleted, the scheduled transaction will be marked as deleted, and the consensus timestamp of the deletion will be recorded.

**Transaction Signing Requirements**

* The signature of the admin key
