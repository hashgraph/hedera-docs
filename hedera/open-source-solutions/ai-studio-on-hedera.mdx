## Getting Started

With the AI Studio, developers can use the SDK to build agents that can interact with the Hedera network, query Hedera mirror nodes, and use native Hedera services to build agents that can use natural laguage to query and carry out actions on Hedera.

* [**Try the 60-second quickstart**](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-agent-kit/blob/main/docs/DEVEXAMPLES.md). Use npm to install the latest version of the agent kit and create a simple "Hello Hedera Agent Kit"
* Clone and [**try out different examples**](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-agent-kit/blob/main/docs/DEVEXAMPLES.md) in the toolkit:
  * The **example tool calling agent** can carry out simple tasks with hedera tools in 'autonomous mode'
  * The **structured chat agent** can string together and complete more complex tasks, autonomously on Hedera
  * The **human in the loop agent** shows you how you can create a more controlled workflow
  * **Try out the MCP server** to enable interaction with Hedera in your favorite application such as Claude Desktop or an IDE like Cursor.
  * Build and **ElizaOS Agent** that can transact and query the Hedera Network with the [**Hedera ElizaOS Plugin**](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-hedera)\\
