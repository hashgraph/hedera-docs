## Account ID

The account ID is the unique identifier for an account on the Hedera network, formatted as `<shardNum>.<realmNum>.<account>`. This ID is used to specify the account in all Hedera transactions and queries. An account can be represented by more than one ID format.

<Check>
  #### Support for Arbitrary Shards & RealmSupport for Arbitrary Shards & Realms

  The Hedera network supports non-zero realm IDs (e.g., `0.100.0`), which is particularly important for private networks. The default for Hedera Mainnet is `shard 0` and `realm 0`. For other networks, refer to the specific documentation for accurate values.
</Check>

<Accordion title="Shard Number">
  Format: **`shardNum`**`.realmNum.account`

  The shard number identifies the shard where the account exists. A shard is a partition of the network. Currently, Hedera operates on a single shard, so this value is `0`.

  Default Hedera Mainnet: `0`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Realm Number">
  Format: `shardNum.`**`realNum`**`.account`

  The realm number identifies the realm within a shard. Hedera currently operates in a single realm, so this value is `0`.

  Default for Hedera Mainnet: `0`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Account">
  Format: `shardNum.realNum.`**`account`**

  The `account` part of the ID can be one of the following:

  - [Account Number](#account-number)
  - [EVM Address](#evm-address)
  - [Account Alias](#account-alias)
</Accordion>

#### Examples of Valid Account IDs

- `0.0.123` - Account 123 in `realm 0` of `shard 0` (traditional format)
- `0.100.456` - Account 456 in `realm 100` of `shard 0` (non-zero realm ID)
- `1.0.789` - Account 789 in `realm 0` of `shard 1` (future support for non-zero shard ID)

### ID Requirements

- A shard number must be unique across the network.
- A realm number must be unique within a shard.
- An entity number must be unique within a realm.

### Entity Counter

Each realm maintains a single counter for assigning entity numbers to ensure uniqueness across accounts, files, and smart contracts within that realm.

### **Account Number**

Each Hedera account is assigned a system-generated **account number** upon creation. This non-negative, 8-byte number is unique and immutable. The account number is returned in the transaction receipt or record and can be used to specify the account in all Hedera transactions and queries. The format is `<shardNum>.<realmNum>.<accountNum>`.

| **Account Number ID** | **Description**                                    |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| `0.0.10`              | The account number 10 in account number ID format. |

## EVM Address

Every Hedera account has an **EVM address**, which allows it to interact with smart contracts and EVM-based tools. This address is exposed by the Hedera Mirror Node REST API as the `evm_address` field in the `/accounts` endpoint. An EVM address can be derived in two ways:

1. **From the account’s public key**
2. **From the account’s ID**

### EVM Address Derived from Public Key

An EVM address can be derived from an account’s `ECDSA secp256k1` public key. This is a standard EVM address, computed as the last 20 bytes of the Keccak-256 hash of the public key, as described in the [Ethereum Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf). The recovery ID is not included in the hash.

This type of EVM address is assigned to an account during the [auto account creation](/hedera/core-concepts/accounts/auto-account-creation) process and is commonly used in wallets and EVM-based tools.

<Accordion title="EVM Address Derived from Public Key Example">
  The shard and realm numbers are set to `0`, followed by the EVM address.

  **Example**

  EVM Address: `b794f5ea0ba39494ce839613fffba74279579268`

  HEX Encoded EVM Address: `0xb794f5ea0ba39494ce839613fffba74279579268`

  Account ID Format: `0.0.b794f5ea0ba39494ce839613fffba74279579268`
</Accordion>

### EVM Address Derived from Account ID

An EVM address can also be derived from an account ID. This address is a 20-byte, hex-encoded version of the account number, prefixed with 12 bytes of zeros. This format is automatically available for all accounts and ensures EVM compatibility even for accounts without an explicit EVM address set.

This address is not stored in the consensus node state but is calculated by mirror nodes and returned in the `evm_address` field of the account REST API if the account does not have an EVM address derived from a public key.

| **Account ID** | **EVM Address Derived from Account ID**                                                      |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0.0.10`       | The hex encoding value for 10 is “0a.”<br /><br />`000000000000000000000000000000000000000a` |

### Account Alias

An **account alias** is an alternative identifier for a Hedera account, in addition to its account number. An account alias can be a public key or an EVM address. Account aliases are assigned to an account during the [auto account creation](/hedera/core-concepts/accounts/auto-account-creation) process.

The account alias ID has the following format: `<shardNum>.<realmNum>.<alias>`.

This format is only acceptable when specified in the `TransferTransaction`, `AccountInfoQuery`, and `AccountBalanceQuery` transaction types. If this format is used to reference an account in any other transaction type, the transaction will not succeed.

### Recommended Usage for EVM Compatibility

To maximize EVM compatibility, the recommended approach is to:

1. Create accounts with ECDSA keys.
2. Set the **account alias** to the **EVM address derived from the public key**.

This ensures that accounts can interact seamlessly with EVM-based tools, wallets, and smart contracts.

**Note:** If your use case requires key rotation, avoid this approach. Instead, use an account structure that supports key changes, as the EVM address is tied to the original public key.

## Auto Renewals & **Expiration**

<Warning>
  Auto-renewals and expiration (rent) are currently not enabled.
</Warning>

Like the other Hedera entities, accounts take up network storage. To cover the cost of storing an account, a renewal fee will be charged for the storage utilized on the network. This feature is not enabled on the network today; however, in the future, when it is enabled, the account must have sufficient funds to pay for the renewal fees.

The amount charged for renewal will be charged every pre-determined period in seconds. The interval of time the account will be charged is the auto-renew period. The system will automatically charge the account renewal fees. If the account does not have an HBAR balance, it will be suspended for one week before it is deleted from the ledger. You can renew an account during the suspension period.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title=" Expiration Time">
    The effective consensus timestamp at (and after) which the entity is set to expire.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Auto Renew Account">
    The auto-renewal account is the account that will be charged for the auto-renewal fee when the account expires. By default, the auto-renewal account is the account itself. The auto-renewal account can be updated to another account by the account owner. The auto-renewal account must sign the transaction to update the auto-renewal account.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Auto Renew Period">
    The interval at which this account will be charged the auto renewal fees. The maximum auto renew period for an account is be limited to 3 months (8000001 sec seconds). The minimum auto renew period is 30 days. The auto renew period is mutable and can be updated at any time. If there are insufficient funds, then it extends as long as possible. If it is empty when it expires, then it is deleted.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Reference: [HIP-16](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-16)

## Account Memo

A memo is like a short note that lives with the account object in the ledger state and can be viewed on a network explorer when looking up the account. This account memo is limited to 100 characters. The account memo is mutable and can be updated or removed from the account at any time. The account key is required to sign the transaction to facilitate any changes to this property.

<Warning>
  Do not post any private information in the account memo field. This field is visible to all participants in the network.
</Warning>

## Account Nonce

Accounts on Hedera can submit `EthereumTransaction` types processed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on a consensus node. The nonce on the account represents a sequentially incrementing count of the transactions submitted by an account through the `EthereumTransaction` type. The default account nonce value is set to zero.

Reference Hedera Improvement Proposal: [HIP-410](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-410)

## Automatic Token Associations

Hedera accounts must generally approve custom tokens before transferring them into the receiving account. The receiving account must sign the transaction that will associate the tokens, allowing the specified tokens to be deposited into their account. The automatic token association feature allows the account to bypass manually associating the custom token before transferring it into the account.

Accounts can automatically approve up to 5,000 tokens without manually preauthorizing each custom token. Suppose an account needs to hold a balance for custom tokens greater than 5,000. In that case, the account must manually approve each additional token using the transaction to associate the tokens. There is no limit on the total number of tokens an account can hold. This property is mutable and can be changed after it is set.

## **Maximum Auto-Associations**

The property`maxAutoAssociations`defines how many tokens an account can automatically associate with.

| Property Value |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`            | Automatic token associations or airdrops are not allowed; the account must manually associate each token.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## **Balances**

When a new account is created, you can specify an initial HBAR balance for the account. The initial HBAR balance for the token is deducted from the account that is paying to create the new account. Creating an account with an initial balance is optional.A Hedera account can hold a balance of HBAR and custom fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Account balances can be viewed on a [Network Explorer](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/networks/community-mirror-nodes)and queried from mirror node REST APIs or consensus nodes.

| **Token Type**                | **Description**                                                                           | **Token ID Example**                                                            |
| :---------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **HBAR**                      | The native Hedera fungible token used to pay for transaction fees and secure the network. | None                                                                            |
| **Fungible Token**            | Custom fungible tokens created on Hedera.                                                 | The fungible token ID is represented as `0.0.tokenNum`<br /><br />ex: `0.0.100` |
| **Non-Fungible Token (NFTs)** | Custom non-fungible tokens (NFTs) created on Hedera.                                      | NFT ID is represented as `0.0.tokenNum-serialNum`.  ex: `0.0.101-1`             |

## Keys

Each account is required to have at least one key upon creation. If a key is not supplied at the time of account creation, the network will reject the transaction. The individual(s) that have access to the account's private key(s) have access to authorize the transfer of tokens into or out of the account and are required to sign transactions that modify the account. Modifying the account includes changing any property, like the balance, keys, memo, etc.

Accounts can optionally have more than one key associated with them. These kinds of accounts are multi-signature accounts meaning you will require more than one key to sign the transaction to change a property on an account or debit HBARs. The signing requirements for a multi-signature account depend on the account's key chosen key structure. For support of key structures and key types, follow the link below.

<Card title="Keys and Signatures" href="/hedera/core-concepts/keys-and-signatures">
  
</Card>

<Danger>
  Warning: The private key(s) associated with the account is not to be shared with anyone as it will allow others to authorize transactions from your account on your behalf. Sharing your private key is like sharing your bank account password. Please make sure your private keys are stored in a secure wallet.
</Danger>

## Receiver Signature Required

Accounts can optionally require the account to sign any transactions depositing tokens into the account. This feature is set to false by default. If this feature is set to true, the account will be required to sign all transactions that deposit tokens into the account. This property is mutable and can be updated after the account is created.

## **Staking**

Staking in Hedera is taking an account and associating the HBAR balance to a node in the network. Custom fungible or non-fungible token balances an account holds do not contribute to staking on the network. The purpose of staking accounts to a node on the network is to strengthen the security of the network. To contribute to the security of the network, staked accounts can earn rewards in HBAR. Please see this [guide](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/core-concepts/staking)for additional information about the staking rewards program. Contracts can also stake their accounts to earn rewards.

<Note>
  An account can only stake to one node or one account at any given time.
</Note>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Staked Node ID">
    An account can optionally elect to stake its HBAR to a node in the Hedera network. The staked node ID is the node an account can stake to. The full balance of the account is staked to the node. Do not confuse the node ID with the node's account ID. If you stake to the node's account ID, your account will not earn staking rewards.

    The staked account balance is liquid at all times. This means you can transfer HBAR tokens in and out of the account, and your account will continue to be staked to the node without disruption.

    There is no lock-up period. This means the HBAR tokens in your account are not held for a period of time before you can use them.

    The node ID for a node can be found [here](/hedera/networks/mainnet/mainnet-nodes) or can be queried from the [nodes REST API](https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/docs/#/network/getNetworkNodes).\\

    Example:

    Node ID: `1`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Staked Account ID">
    An account can optionally elect to stake its HBAR to another account in the Hedera network. This is known as **indirect staking**. The staked account ID is the ID of the account to stake to. The full balance of the account is staked to the specified account.

    There is no lock-up period and the balance is always liquid just like staking to a node.

    Accounts that stake to another account do not earn the staking rewards. For example, If account A is staked to account B, account B will need to be staked to a node in order to contribute to network security and earn staking rewards. Account B will earn the rewards for staking when staked to a node for both the HBAR balances in both Account A + Account B. Account A will not earn rewards for staking.

    Example:

    Account ID: `0.0.10`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Decline to Earn Staking Rewards">
    Accounts can decline to earn staking rewards when they stake to a node or an account. The staked account still contributes to the staking weight of the node, but does not earn rewards or is calculated as part of the payment of the rewards to the other accounts that have elected to earn rewards. By default, all staked accounts will earn rewards unless this boolean flag is set to true. This election can be changed by updating the account properties. Hedera treasury accounts enable this flag to decline earning staking rewards.

    Default: `true` (all accounts accept earning staking rewards if the account is staked)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Check>
  **Daily Rewards for Active Nodes**Hedera now guarantees minimum daily rewards for active nodes on the network. Key features include:

  - **Active Node Definition**: Nodes that create a “judge” in a significant fraction of rounds during a staking period
  - **Minimum Guaranteed Rewards**: Active nodes receive a minimum daily reward amount, configurable by the network
  - **Opt-Out Option**: Node operators can decline rewards by setting the `declineReward` flag to true

  For node operators: To opt out of receiving rewards, use the `setDeclineReward(true)` method when creating or updating your node.**_Reference:_** [**_HIP-1064_**](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-1064)
</Check>

## **Staking Information**

The network stores the staking metadata for an account and contract accounts. This information is returned in account information query requests (`AccountInfoQuery`or`ContractInfoQuery`). The staking metadata for an account includes the following information:

- **decline_reward:** whether or not the account declined to earn staking rewards
- **stake_period_start:** The staking period during which either the staking settings for this account or contract changed (such as starting staking or changing staked_node_id) or the most recent reward was earned, whichever is later. If this account or contract is not currently staked to a node, then this field is not set. The stake period is 24 hours, starting UTC midnight.
- **pending_reward:** The amount in tinybars that will be received in the next staking reward payment
- **staked_to_me:** The total tinybar balance of all accounts staked to this account
- **staked_id:** ID of the account or node to which this account or contract is staking
  - **staked_account_id:** The account to which this account or contract is staking to
  - **staked_node_id:** The ID of the node this account or contract is staked to
