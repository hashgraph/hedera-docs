title: "Delete a topic"
---


A transaction that deletes a topic from the Hedera network. Once a topic is deleted, the topic cannot be recovered to receive messages and all submitMessage calls will fail. Older messages can still be accessed, even after the topic is deleted, via the mirror node.

**Transaction Signing Requirements**

* If the adminKey was set upon the creation of the topic, the adminKey is required to sign to successfully delete the topic.
* If no adminKey was set upon the creating of the topic, you cannot delete the topic and will receive an UNAUTHORIZED error.
