title: "Get smart contract bytecode"
---


A query that returns the bytecode for a smart contract instance. Anyone can request the byte code of a smart contract instance on the network. Queries do not change the state of the smart contract or require network consensus. The information is returned from a single node processing the query.

<Note>
#### **Consider Using Mirror Node REST API**

For obtaining smart contract information and historical data, consider using the Mirror Node REST API endpoint [**Get Contract by ID**](https://docs.hedera.com/api-reference/contracts/get-contract-by-id) which offers several advantages:

* **Cost-effective and scalable:** [Mirror node providers](/hedera/core-concepts/mirror-nodes/hedera-mirror-node#mainnet) offer paid plans with a large number of queries included. The Hedera-hosted mirror node offers free queries with specific throttles for testing. While some SDK queries are currently free, these are subject to change in the future.
* **Performance:** Mirror nodes don't burden consensus nodes, allowing them to focus on processing transactions and providing efficient access to historical data without impacting network performance.
* **Historical data:** Mirror nodes store complete transaction history, records, and events - ideal for analytics, auditing, and monitoring past activity.
</Note>

**Query Signing Requirements**

* The client operator account's private key (fee payer) is required to sign this query

**Query Fees**

* Please see the transaction and query [fees](/hedera/networks/mainnet/fees#transaction-and-query-fees) table for the base transaction fee
* Please use the [Hedera fee estimator](https://hedera.com/fees) to estimate your query fee cost

| Method                        | Type       | Description                                       | Requirements |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `setContractId(<contractId>)` | ContractId | The ID of the contract to return the bytecode for | Required     |

<CodeGroup>

```java Java
//Create the query
ContractByteCodeQuery query = new ContractByteCodeQuery()
    .setContractId(contractId);

//Sign with the client operator private key and submit to a Hedera network
ByteString bytecode = query.execute(client);
```


```javascript JavaScript
//Create the query
const query = new ContractByteCodeQuery()
    .setContractId(contractId);

//Sign with the client operator private key and submit to a Hedera network
const bytecode = await query.execute(client);
```


```java Go
//Create the query
query := hedera.NewContractByteCodeQuery().
    SetContractID(contractId)

//Sign with the client operator private key to pay for the query and submit the query to a Hedera network
bytecode, err := query.Execute(client)

if err != nil {
        panic(err)
}
```


```rust Rust
// Create the query
let query = ContractByteCodeQuery::new()
    .contract_id(contract_id);

// Sign with the client operator private key and submit to a Hedera network
let bytecode = query.execute(&client).await?;

println!("Contract bytecode: {:?}", bytecode);
