| `pre`   | string | A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dot separated identifiers (https://semver.org/#spec-item-9); so given a semver 0.14.0-alpha.1+21AF26D3, this field would contain 'alpha.1'                                                      |
| `build` | build  | Build metadata MAY be denoted by appending a plus sign and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch or pre-release version (https://semver.org/#spec-item-10); so given a semver 0.14.0-alpha.1+21AF26D3, this field would contain '21AF26D3' |
