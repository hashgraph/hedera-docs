title: "Delegate Contract ID"
---


A smart contract that, if the recipient of the active message frame, should be treated as having signed. Note that this does not mean the *code being executed in the frame* will belong to the given contract since it could be running another contract's code via `delegatecall`. Setting this key is a more permissive version of the `contractID` key, which also requires the code in the active message frame to belong to the contract with the given id. See [HIP-206: Hedera Token Service Precompiled Contract for Hedera SmartContract Service](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-206#contract-key) for more details.

The delegate contract ID can be set as `Key`.
