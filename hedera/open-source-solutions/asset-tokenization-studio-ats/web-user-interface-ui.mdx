    New bonds are debt securities issued by entities (corporate or government) to raise money. Investors receive periodic interest (coupons) and the principal at maturity. Tokenizing a bond digitally represents it on the blockchain or other form of distributed ledger, allowing fractional ownership and easier transferability of tokens.

    New equity represents ownership in a company or asset, entitling holders to a share of assets, profits, dividends, and voting rights. Through asset tokenization, digital tokens representing shares are issued on a blockchain or other form of distributed ledger, offering investors easy access, transferability, and voting rights.

## Regulations

Before we start tokenizing assets into digital securities, let's review some important regulatory information to understand the applicable restrictions and rules for both types (bonds and equities) of securities that ATS supports. The current jurisdiction for digital securities is limited to the United States, meaning all legal and regulatory frameworks concerning the issuance, management, and trading of the tokenized asset are in conformity with U.S. laws. While designed to be flexible for more jurisdictions in the near future, for the time being, all the offerings of tokenized instruments shall fall under the ambit of American laws.

<Warning>
**Important**: Please read the restrictions applicable to the selected regulation carefully and ensure your deal is compliant. Once published, these details cannot be altered. It is recommended to consult your legal and financial advisor for regulations applicable to your digital security.
</Warning>

<Accordion title="Regulation Terms Defined">
* **Deal Size**: The total amount of capital that can be raised through this offering. This could represent an unlimited or capped amount, depending on the specific tokenization project or regulatory constraints.

- **Accredited Investors**: Investors who meet specific financial criteria (e.g., income, net worth) as defined by regulatory standards. Participation in certain tokenized offerings may be restricted to accredited investors due to regulatory requirements.

* **Max Non-Accredited Investors**: The maximum number of non-accredited investors allowed to participate in the digital security offering. Digital securities may impose limits on non-accredited investor participation to comply with securities regulations, ensuring the offering remains within certain legal frameworks.

- **Manual Investor Verification**: This is a process where investors must provide financial documentation or proof of identity, which is manually verified to ensure compliance with KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulations. In digital securities offerings, this step ensures that only eligible participants can invest in the asset.

* **International Investors**: Refers to the participation of investors from other countries in the digital security offering. Tokenized offerings may allow or restrict international investors based on local or international regulations, tax considerations, and compliance requirements.

- **Resale Hold Period**: The minimum time an investor must wait before they can resell their digital security on secondary markets. The resale hold period is often mandated by regulatory bodies to prevent early liquidation and to comply with securities laws, ensuring the stability and legality of the offering.
</Accordion>

#### Blocklist

The blocklist is responsible for prohibiting specific investors from participating in a tokenized offering. Investors from the countries mentioned on this blocklist would not be able to invest in the digital security. This functionality allows an issuer to adhere to particular legal, regulatory, or operational constraints applied to specific jurisdictions. For this, the issuer can select a country and then blocklist it to ensure that residents of that country do not create or participate in an offering.

<Info>
**Important**: Investors from only the countries specified below will not be allowed to invest.

* **Name**: Bond's name.
* **Symbol**: Bond's symbol.
* **Decimals**: Number of decimals units (default is 6).
* **ISIN**: International Security Identification Number - this can be any 12 alphanumeric characters.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/open-source-solutions/asset-tokenization-studio-ats/web-user-interface-ui/asset-tokenization-studio-create-bond-details.png" />
</Frame>

#### Bond Permissions

Toggle the permissions you want to enable for your new bond:

* **Controllable**: Enables token controller role and compliance operations.
* **Blocklist**: Enables access control to the security using a list of blocked accounts.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/open-source-solutions/asset-tokenization-studio-ats/web-user-interface-ui/asset-tokenization-studio-create-bond-permissions.png" />
</Frame>

### Bond Configuration

* **Clearing Mode**: (Default: Unchecked)
  * **What it does**: Enables two-step settlement requiring validator approval
  * **How it works**:
    1. User initiates transfer/redemption/hold – Operation created (pending)
    2. Clearing Validator reviews operation – Approves or Cancels
    3. If approved – operation executes
    4. If cancelled/expired – User can reclaim tokens
* **Internal KYC Activated**
  * **What it does**: Simplified KYC system without external dependencies
  * **How it works**:
    * KYC managed directly within the token contract
    * No need for External KYC List contracts
    * SSI Manager grants/revokes KYC
    * Requires VC files for compliance tracking
  * **Impact**: KYC managed in token vs separate contract

**Note**: You can add Internal KYC later from the token's detail page.

## Manage Roles

In Asset Tokenization Studio (ATS), role management is a crucial feature that provides control over various functions related to the management and operation of digital securities. If your account is assigned the *Admin Role*, you can manage other roles for your security tokens, making governance easier and more secure.

<Warning>
To operate and manage digital securities within Asset Tokenization Studio, you must first assign roles to your connected wallet or account. Without the appropriate roles, you will not have the necessary permissions to perform operations such as minting tokens, managing corporate actions, or updating compliance settings. Be sure to grant yourself the required roles through the role management tab for each security to gain full access to manage your tokenized assets.
</Warning>

Roles you can manage include:

* **Admin**: Grants full administrative privileges, including the ability to assign and manage all other roles.
* **Minter**: Permits the account to mint new tokens, increasing the supply of the asset.
* **Controller**: Authorizes the account to execute specific control actions over the tokenized asset, such as regulatory or operational updates.
* **Pause**: Allows the account to temporarily halt all transactions for the asset, useful in emergencies or during maintenance.
* **Control List**: Manages approval lists and blacklists, determining which accounts can or cannot participate in asset transactions.
* **Corporate Actions**: Enables the execution of corporate actions like dividend distributions or token conversions.
* **Document**: Grants the ability to manage and update asset-related documents, such as legal or compliance files.
* **Snapshot**: Authorizes the creation of snapshots, capturing the state of token holder balances at a specific point in time for reporting or auditing purposes.

Connect your wallet and select the digital security you want to manage from the Admin (mode) dashboard.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/open-source-solutions/asset-tokenization-studio-ats/web-user-interface-ui/web-user-interface-ui-16.png" />
</Frame>

Once the asset information loads, navigate to the "Role Management" tab to assign or modify roles. Enter the account ID to which you want to assign roles.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/open-source-solutions/asset-tokenization-studio-ats/web-user-interface-ui/web-user-interface-ui-17.png" />
</Frame>

## Manage Securities

After assigning roles, ATS will display all operations available for each digital security based on the roles your account has been assigned. Simply click on the corresponding tab and follow the on-screen prompts to complete each operation. Here's a rundown of the available operations by dashboard mode:

#### Admin (mode) Dashboard

* **Mint**: Allows the creation of new tokens for the security, increasing the total supply based on the issuer’s parameters.
* **Force Transfer**: Enables the transfer of tokens from one account to another without the token holder's consent, often used in cases of legal or regulatory necessity.
* **Dividends**: Programs dividend payments for equity tokens, specifying how and when dividends will be distributed to token holders. It also provides an overview of all programmed dividend payouts, including past, pending, or upcoming payments, allowing the issuer or investor to track distributions.
* **Balances**: Shows the balance of tokens held by various investors, offering a snapshot of current token holdings for the selected security.
* **Blocked List**: Manages a list of blocked or restricted investors who are prohibited from participating in token transactions, ensuring compliance with KYC/AML requirements.
* **Voting Rights**: Assigns, adjusts, or displays voting rights for security token holders, allowing them to participate in governance decisions, such as corporate actions or board elections.
* **Role Management**: Enables the assignment and management of roles (e.g., Admin, Minter, Controller) for specific users, determining their permissions and access to various operations within the digital security.

<Frame>

</Frame>

#### Holder (mode) Dashboard

* **Transfer**: Allows token holders to send their security tokens to another account or wallet, following any compliance rules.
* **Redeem**: Enables token holders to return their tokens to the issuer in exchange for cash, removing them from circulation.
* **Balance**: Displays the token holder's current balance, providing a real-time view of the total tokens held for the selected asset.

#### Step 2: Add Yourself as SSI Issuer

**What is an SSI Manager/Issuer?**

The **SSI Manager** manages the list of **trusted issuers** * entities authorized to sign Verifiable Credentials (VCs) that your token will accept for KYC purposes. Think of it like a whitelist of "trusted KYC providers."

* **SSI Manager Role** (`SSI_MANAGER_ROLE`): Can add/remove trusted issuers
* **Issuer**: An account that signs Verifiable Credentials
  * Can be you (self-issued KYC)
  * Can be a KYC service
  * Can be a financial institution (bank, broker)
  * Can be a regulatory authority

**How to add:**

1. Make sure you have assigned yourself the SSI Role under 'Roles'
2. Go to token detail → **SST Manager** tab
3. Click **Add Issuer**
4. Enter your **Hedera Account ID**: `0.0.xxx` (the account that will sign VCs)
5. Click **Add**

Now your account is authorized to issue Verifiable Credentials that this token will trust for KYC.

</Frame>

#### Step 3: Grant KYC via UI

1. Go to token detail → **KYC** tab
2. Click **Add** button
3. **Fill Form**:
   * **Account ID**: `0.0.1234567`
   * **VC File**: Upload the `.vc` file (can be generated in the ATS repository - needs hardhat)
4. Click **Create**
5. Sign transaction
