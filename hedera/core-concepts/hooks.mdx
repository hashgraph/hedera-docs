description: Learn about Hedera Hooks, an experimental feature for programmable transaction execution
---

## What are Hooks?

Hooks are an experimental feature in the Hedera network that enable programmable logic to be executed automatically during transaction processing. They provide a mechanism for accounts to define custom code that runs in response to specific transaction events, similar to smart contract callbacks but with different execution characteristics.

<Warning>
**Experimental Feature**: Hooks are currently an experimental feature that has been disabled in production environments. The feature is under active development and may undergo significant changes before general availability.
</Warning>

## Purpose and Use Cases

Hooks are designed to enable several advanced use cases:

### Transaction Automation
- Execute custom logic automatically when certain transaction conditions are met
- Implement complex business rules without requiring separate smart contract deployments
- Create programmable accounts with built-in transaction processing logic

### State Management
- Maintain custom storage state associated with hook execution
- Track transaction history and patterns
- Implement account-level state machines

### Integration with CryptoTransfer
Hooks can interact with `CryptoTransfer` operations to:
- Validate transfer conditions before execution
- Apply custom fee logic
- Implement transfer restrictions or allowlists
- Trigger side effects based on transfer patterns

## Current Status

### Network Availability

| Network | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Mainnet | Disabled |
| Testnet | Disabled |
| Previewnet | Disabled |

### Implementation Status

According to the release notes:

- **Release 0.71.1**: Hooks were explicitly disabled ([#23502](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/pull/23502))
- **Release 0.71.0**: Hook functionality was enabled but later disabled
- **Release 0.69**: Hooks were disabled in version 0.69
- **Release 0.67**: `HookDispatch` authorization was reverted

The feature has been toggled on and off during development as the implementation is refined and tested.

### Mirror Node Support

The Hedera Mirror Node has implemented support for hooks through [HIP-1195](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-1195):

- **Release 0.144.0**: Added REST API endpoint `/api/v1/accounts/{id}/hooks/{hookId}/storage` to query hook storage state
- **Release 0.143.0**: Added REST API endpoint `/api/v1/accounts/{id}/hooks` to list hooks owned by an account
- **Release 0.147.0**: Updated to rename `LambdaSStore` to `HookStore` for consistency

## Technical Architecture

### Hook Storage

Hooks maintain their own storage state, similar to smart contracts:

```json
{
  "hook_id": 1,
  "owner_id": "0.0.123",
  "storage": [
    {
      "key": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
      "value": "0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003e8",
      "timestamp": "1726874345.123456789"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Hook Execution

When enabled, hooks execute during transaction processing:

1. **HookDispatch**: The mechanism that triggers hook execution based on transaction type
2. **HookExecution**: The actual execution of hook code during `CryptoTransfer` or other operations
3. **HookStore**: The storage system for maintaining hook state between executions

## Relationship to Smart Contracts

Hooks differ from smart contracts in several key ways:

| Feature | Hooks | Smart Contracts |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Execution Trigger | Automatic during transactions | Explicit contract calls |
| Storage Model | Account-associated storage | Contract-associated storage |
| Deployment | Associated with accounts | Deployed as separate entities |
| Gas Model | TBD (under development) | Standard EVM gas |
| State | Lightweight, transaction-focused | Full EVM state machine |

## Development Timeline

The hooks feature is following this general development path:

1. **Initial Implementation**: Core hook execution and storage mechanisms
2. **Testing Phase**: Extensive testing on development networks
3. **Mirror Node Integration**: REST API support for querying hook data
4. **Security Review**: Comprehensive security analysis before production
5. **Controlled Rollout**: Gradual enablement with monitoring
6. **General Availability**: Full production release (future)

## Monitoring Hook Status

To stay informed about hooks development:

1. **Release Notes**: Check the [Services Release Notes](/hedera/networks/release-notes/services) for updates
2. **Mirror Node Release Notes**: Review [Mirror Node Release Notes](/hedera/networks/release-notes/mirror-node) for API changes
3. **HIP Repository**: Follow [HIP-1195](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-1195) for specification updates
4. **GitHub Issues**: Monitor the [hedera-services repository](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services) for implementation progress

## Future Availability

When hooks are enabled for production use, this documentation will be updated with:

- Complete API reference for hook operations
- Code examples for creating and managing hooks
- Best practices for hook development
- Gas and fee schedules
- Security considerations and limitations

<Info>
**Developer Note**: While hooks are not currently available for production use, developers interested in this feature should monitor the HIP-1195 proposal and related GitHub discussions for updates on when the feature will be enabled.
