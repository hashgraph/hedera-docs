<summary><strong>ðŸš§</strong> <strong>What's new: Hardhat 2 â†’ 3</strong> </summary>

Key differences in Hardhat 3:

* **compile â†’ build**\
  `npx hardhat compile` is now `npx hardhat build`. This is the big one. The v3 migration guide explicitly shows using the `build` task.
* **project init switch**\
  v2 commonly used `npx hardhat` or `npx hardhat init` to bootstrap. In v3 itâ€™s `npx hardhat --init`.

- **keystore helper commands are new**\
  v3â€™s recommended flow includes a keystore plugin with commands like `npx hardhat keystore set HEDERA_RPC_URL` and `npx hardhat keystore set HEDERA_PRIVATE_KEY`. These werenâ€™t standard in v2.
- **Foundry-compatiable Solidity tests**\
  In addition to offering Javascript/Typescript integration tests, Hardhat v3 also integrates Foundry-compatible Solidity tests that allows developers to write unit tests directly in Solidity

* **Enhanced Network Management**\
  v3 allows tasks to create and manage multiple network connections simultaneously which is a significant improvement over the single, fixed connection available in version 2. This provides greater flexibility for scripts and tests that interact with multiple networks.
