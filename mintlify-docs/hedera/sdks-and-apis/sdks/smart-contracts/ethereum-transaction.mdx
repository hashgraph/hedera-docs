title: "Ethereum transaction"
---


An `EthereumTransaction` lets you execute a raw, RLP-encoded (type 0, 1, or 2) Ethereum transaction on the Hedera network. This enables developers familiar with EVM tooling to leverage their existing knowledge and infrastructure when interacting with the [Hedera Smart Contract Service (HSCS)](/hedera/tutorials/smart-contracts).

<Warning>
#### **Important**

Hedera interprets HBAR decimals differently depending on the context:

* The lowest denomination of HBAR when used within a the `value` field in the `EthereumTransaction` is `weibars` meaning with `18` decimals
* The lowest denomination of hbar when used within `data` or the Hedera EVM is `tinybars` meaning with `8` decimals.
* Gas Price information is in `weibars` denomination.\

<table><thead><tr><th>Field</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Ethereum Data</strong></td><td>An RLP-encoded (type 0, 1, or 2) Ethereum transaction to execute on the Hedera network. This enables developers to leverage existing EVM tooling and workflows with the Hedera Smart Contract Service (HSCS).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Call Data File ID</strong></td><td>An optional field referencing a file on the Hedera File Service (HFS) containing the <code>callData</code>. When set, the network ignores the <code>callData</code> in <code>ethereumData</code> during execution and instead loads the data from the referenced file. However, the full <code>callData</code> must still be present in the originally signed <code>ethereumData</code> for signature validation. In this case, <code>ethereumData</code> will contain a placeholder where <code>callData</code> normally resides, and the transaction must be "rehydrated" with the HFS content during validation.<br/><br/><em><strong>Note:</strong> With</em> <a href="https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-1086"><em>HIP-1086</em></a><em>, jumbo <code>ethereumData</code> is the preferred approach for large payloads, but <code>callDataFileId</code> remains supported for oversized payloads or legacy workflows.</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Max Allowance</strong></td><td><p>The maximum amount of HBAR (specified in <strong>tinybars</strong>) the payer is willing to cover for the gas consumed during transaction execution. This value acts as a ceiling if the actual gas cost (determined by <code>gasLimit</code> in the RLP-encoded transaction and the network's gas price) exceeds this amount, the transaction fails.<br/></p><p>Ordinarily, the account with the ECDSA alias extracted from the <code>ethereumData</code> signature covers the execution fees. If insufficient fees are authorized by that account, the payer can be charged up to but not exceeding <code>maxGasAllowance</code>. If the authorized fee is zero, the payer is charged the full amount.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Handling Large callData Payloads

[**HIP-1086**](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-1086) introduced support for **jumbo Ethereum transactions**, allowing `ethereumData` to directly include `callData` up to **24KB** for contract creation and **128KB** for contract calls. This removes the need to use `callDataFileId` for many large payloads. The rest of the protobuf wrapper (signatures, node account ID, etc.) must still fit within **2KB**.

#### Gas Calculation for callData

The gas cost for the `callData` in jumbo EthereumTransaction is calculated as:

```
callData gas = 4 Ã— zero bytes + 16 Ã— non-zero bytes
```

This is added to base gas and execution gas. Developers must ensure both `gasLimit` (in the RLP-encoded transaction) and `maxGasAllowance` (in the wrapper) are set high enough.

## **Transaction Signing Requirements**

The transaction must be signed by the key of the **fee-paying account**. For `EthereumTransaction`, this is:

* The account with the **ECDSA alias** derived from the public key in `ethereumData`, if sufficient gas and fees are authorized.
* If the authorized fee from the Ethereum sender is **insufficient**, the payer of the transaction is charged up to the **`maxGasAllowance`**.
* For jumbo transactions, ensure the payerâ€™s key is included and `maxGasAllowance` is set high enough to cover potential gas and fees.

## **Transaction Fees**

The total transaction cost includes:

* Base transaction fee
* Gas for `callData`, (calculated as: `4 Ã— zero bytes + 16 Ã— non-zero bytes`)
* Execution gas determined by EVM smart contract logic
