# Ethereum transaction

An `EthereumTransaction` lets you execute a raw, RLP-encoded (type 0, 1, or 2) Ethereum transaction on the Hedera network. This enables developers familiar with EVM tooling to leverage their existing knowledge and infrastructure when interacting with the [Hedera Smart Contract Service (HSCS)](../../../tutorials/smart-contracts/).

#### **Important**

Hedera interprets HBAR decimals differently depending on the context:

* The lowest denomination of HBAR when used within a the `value` field in the `EthereumTransaction` is `weibars` meaning with `18` decimals
* The lowest denomination of hbar when used within `data` or the Hedera EVM is `tinybars` meaning with `8` decimals.
* Gas Price information is in `weibars` denomination.\

When set, the network ignores the <code>callData</code> in <code>ethereumData</code> during execution and instead loads the data from the referenced file. However, the full <code>callData</code> must still be present in the originally signed <code>ethereumData</code> for signature validation. In this case, <code>ethereumData</code> will contain a placeholder where <code>callData</code> normally resides, and the transaction must be "rehydrated" with the HFS content during validation.<br><br><em><strong>Note:</strong> With</em> <a href="https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-1086"><em>HIP-1086</em></a><em>, jumbo <code>ethereumData</code> is the preferred approach for large payloads, but <code>callDataFileId</code> remains supported for oversized payloads or legacy workflows.</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Max Allowance</strong></td><td><p>The maximum amount of HBAR (specified in <strong>tinybars</strong>) the payer is willing to cover for the gas consumed during transaction execution. This value acts as a ceiling if the actual gas cost (determined by <code>gasLimit</code> in the RLP-encoded transaction and the network's gas price) exceeds this amount, the transaction fails.<br></p><p>Ordinarily, the account with the ECDSA alias extracted from the <code>ethereumData</code> signature covers the execution fees. If insufficient fees are authorized by that account, the payer can be charged up to but not exceeding <code>maxGasAllowance</code>.

## Handling Large callData Payloads

[**HIP-1086**](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-1086) introduced support for **jumbo Ethereum transactions**, allowing `ethereumData` to directly include `callData` up to **24KB** for contract creation and **128KB** for contract calls. This removes the need to use `callDataFileId` for many large payloads. The rest of the protobuf wrapper (signatures, node account ID, etc.) must still fit within **2KB**.

#### Gas Calculation for callData

The gas cost for the `callData` in jumbo EthereumTransaction is calculated as:

```
callData gas = 4 Ã— zero bytes + 16 Ã— non-zero bytes
```

This is added to base gas and execution gas. Developers must ensure both `gasLimit` (in the RLP-encoded transaction) and `maxGasAllowance` (in the wrapper) are set high enough.

_ðŸ“£ For detailed gas and fee calculation, refer to the_ [_Gas and Fees page_](../../../core-concepts/smart-contracts/gas-and-fees.md#gas-for-jumbo-transactions)_._&#x20;

## **Transaction Signing Requirements**

The transaction must be signed by the key of the **fee-paying account**. For `EthereumTransaction`, this is:

* The account with the **ECDSA alias** derived from the public key in `ethereumData`, if sufficient gas and fees are authorized.
* If the authorized fee from the Ethereum sender is **insufficient**, the payer of the transaction is charged up to the **`maxGasAllowance`**.
* For jumbo transactions, ensure the payerâ€™s key is included and `maxGasAllowance` is set high enough to cover potential gas and fees.

## **Transaction Fees**

The total transaction cost includes:

* Base transaction fee
* Gas for `callData`, (calculated as: `4 Ã— zero bytes + 16 Ã— non-zero bytes`)
* Execution gas determined by EVM smart contract logic
