When documenting or referring to "web2" and "web3," it's important to maintain consistency. Both terms should be in lowercase. The only exception to this rule is when either term starts a sentence. In such cases, the initial letter should be capitalized. For example:

* ❌ **Incorrect**: "web3 technologies are evolving rapidly."
* ✅ **Correct**: "Web3 represents a shift towards decentralization."
* ✅ **Correct**: "In the context of web2, user data is often controlled by centralized entities."
* ✅ **Correct**: "The principles of transparency and user empowerment are fundamental to the development of web3 platforms."
