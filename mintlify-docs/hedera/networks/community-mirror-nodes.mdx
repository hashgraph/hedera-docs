Hedera network explorers are tools for tracking activity on the Hedera network. Mirror nodes provide real-time data on transactions, while network explorers offer a user-friendly interface for viewing and searching those transactions.

Check out some of the community-hosted network explorer services listed below. Each community-hosted network explorer may have their own unique features and experience.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How do I search for a transaction?">
To search for a specific transaction, you can use the unique transaction ID.

The transaction ID should look something like this: `0.0.48750443@1671560120.085845879`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I get the transaction ID?">
The transaction ID can be automatically generated by the SDK, manually created and associated with a transaction, or obtained from the receipt or record after the transaction has been processed. It serves as a unique identifier for the transaction and can be used to search for and view its details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I search for an entity (account, topic, tokens, smart contracts)?">
You can search by the unique ID of the entity you are looking for. The entity ID format is `0.0.entityNumber`.

For example, `0.0.2` is an account ID and you search for that account using that ID.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I get the entity ID?">
Entity IDs are returned in the receipt of the transaction that created them. Entities include accounts, topics, smart contracts, schedules, and tokens.

For example, if you create a new account using the `AccountCreateTransaction` in the SDK, you can get the new account ID from the transaction receipt.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I host my own Hedera network explorer?">
