# TokenUpdate

Updates an already created Token.

If no value is given for a field, that field is left unchanged. For an immutable token (that is, a token created without an adminKey), only the expiry may be updated. Setting any other field, in that case, will cause the transaction status to resolve to TOKEN\_IS\_IMMUTABlE.
