## Regulations

Before we start tokenizing assets into digital securities, let's review some important regulatory information to understand the applicable restrictions and rules for both types (bonds and equities) of securities that ATS supports. The current jurisdiction for digital securities is limited to the United States, meaning all legal and regulatory frameworks concerning the issuance, management, and trading of the tokenized asset are in conformity with U.S. laws. While designed to be flexible for more jurisdictions in the near future, for the time being, all the offerings of tokenized instruments shall fall under the ambit of American laws.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**: Please read the restrictions applicable to the selected regulation carefully and ensure your deal is compliant. Once published, these details cannot be altered. It is recommended to consult your legal and financial advisor for regulations applicable to your digital security.

## Create New Bond

#### Bond General Information

To initiate the creation of a new bond, choose New Bond and enter the basic details of the new bond:

* **Name**: Bond's name.
* **Symbol**: Bond's symbol.
* **Decimals**: Number of decimals units (default is 6).
* **ISIN**: International Security Identification Number - this can be any 12 alphanumeric characters.

#### Bond Permissions

Toggle the permissions you want to enable for your new bond:

* **Controllable**: Enables token controller role and compliance operations.
* **Blocklist**: Enables access control to the security using a list of blocked accounts.
* **Approval list**: Enables access control to the security using a list of approved/allowed accounts.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/asset-tokenization-bond-creation.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Bond Details

Enter the bond details, such as the nominal value, number of bond units, starting (mint) date, and maturity date.

* **Number of Bond Units**: The total number of bond tokens to be issued. Each unit represents a fraction of the overall bond and can be bought, sold, or transferred.
* **Nominal Value**: The face value of each bond unit, which is the amount the issuer agrees to repay the bondholder at maturity.&#x20;
* **Starting Date**: The issuance or minting date of the bond, marking the official start of the bond's term. It is the date from which interest (coupon) payments start to accrue.
* **Maturity Date**: The date when the bond reaches its full term, and the issuer is obligated to repay the bondholders the nominal value of the bond units, along with any remaining interest payments.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/asset-tokenization-bond-creation-configuration.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Coupons

Define the bond's interest payment structure, including coupon type (fixed or custom), rate, payment frequency, and the first coupon date.

* **Coupon Type**: The structure of the interest payments (coupons) that the bond will provide.
  * **Fixed**: A bond with a fixed coupon pays a set interest rate over its lifetime, regardless of market fluctuations.
  * **Custom**: A bond with zero coupons by default, but flexible or floating coupon rates can be added later. This option allows for custom interest structures through the "Set Coupons" tab.
* **Coupon Rate**: The interest rate paid on each coupon. It is expressed as a percentage of the bond's nominal value and determines the periodic payments made to bondholders.
* **Coupon Frequency**: Defines the interval between two consecutive coupon payments, measured in months (each month is assumed to have 30 days). For example, a frequency of 6 months means that bondholders will receive interest payments every six months.
* **First Coupon Date**: The first date when a coupon payment will be recorded and made to bondholders. All subsequent coupon payment dates are automatically calculated based on the coupon frequency and the first coupon's date.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/asset-tokenization-bond-creation-coupon.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Proceed Recipients

Define the recipients who will receive the bond proceeds from the offering. This step allows you to specify one or more Hedera accounts that will receive the funds raised from the bond issuance.

* **Address**: The Hedera account ID of the recipient who will receive bond proceeds. This must be a valid Hedera account ID format.
* **Data**: Optional additional data or notes associated with the recipient for record-keeping purposes.

You can add multiple proceed recipients by entering each address and clicking "Add Proceed Recipient". The recipients table will display all configured recipients, and you can remove any entry using the delete action.

### ERC-3643

Configure ERC-3643 compliance settings for your bond. ERC-3643 is a standard for permissioned tokens that enables compliance with securities regulations through on-chain compliance rules and identity verification.

* **Compliance ID**: The Hedera account ID of the compliance smart contract that will enforce the regulatory rules for this bond. This is optional and can be left empty if not using ERC-3643 compliance.
* **Identity Registry ID**: The Hedera account ID of the identity registry contract that manages investor identities and their compliance status. This is optional and can be left empty if not using ERC-3643 identity management.

Both fields accept valid Hedera account IDs and are used to integrate with existing ERC-3643 compliance infrastructure.

### External Lists

Configure external management lists for enhanced control over your bond. These external lists provide additional layers of security and compliance by integrating with external smart contracts.

* **External Pause List**: Select from available external pause contracts that can trigger emergency pauses of token operations. Multiple pause contracts can be selected to provide redundant safety mechanisms.
* **External Control List**: Choose external control contracts that provide additional governance and control capabilities over the bond token. This allows for sophisticated multi-party control structures.
* **External KYC List**: Select external KYC (Know Your Customer) verification contracts that validate investor identities and compliance status. This enables integration with third-party KYC providers.

For each list type, you can select multiple contracts from the available options. Selected contracts will appear as tags that can be removed if needed.

## Manage Roles

In Asset Tokenization Studio (ATS), role management is a crucial feature that provides control over various functions related to the management and operation of digital securities. If your account is assigned the _Admin Role_, you can manage other roles for your security tokens, making governance easier and more secure.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To operate and manage digital securities within Asset Tokenization Studio, you must first assign roles to your connected wallet or account. Without the appropriate roles, you will not have the necessary permissions to perform operations such as minting tokens, managing corporate actions, or updating compliance settings. Be sure to grant yourself the required roles through the role management tab for each security to gain full access to manage your tokenized assets.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Roles you can manage include:&#x20;

* **Admin**: Grants full administrative privileges, including the ability to assign and manage all other roles.
* **Minter**: Permits the account to mint new tokens, increasing the supply of the asset.
* **Controller**: Authorizes the account to execute specific control actions over the tokenized asset, such as regulatory or operational updates.
* **Pause**: Allows the account to temporarily halt all transactions for the asset, useful in emergencies or during maintenance.
* **Control List**: Manages approval lists and blacklists, determining which accounts can or cannot participate in asset transactions.
* **Corporate Actions**: Enables the execution of corporate actions like dividend distributions or token conversions.
* **Document**: Grants the ability to manage and update asset-related documents, such as legal or compliance files.
* **Snapshot**: Authorizes the creation of snapshots, capturing the state of token holder balances at a specific point in time for reporting or auditing purposes.

Connect your wallet and select the digital security you want to manage from the Admin (mode) dashboard.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/asset-tokenization-admin-all-digital-securities.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once the asset information loads, navigate to the "Role Management" tab to assign or modify roles. Enter the account ID to which you want to assign roles.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/asset-tokenization-admin-role-management.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Manage Securities

After assigning roles, ATS will display all operations available for each digital security based on the roles your account has been assigned. Simply click on the corresponding tab and follow the on-screen prompts to complete each operation. Here's a rundown of the available operations by dashboard mode:

#### Admin (mode) Dashboard

* **Mint**: Allows the creation of new tokens for the security, increasing the total supply based on the issuer’s parameters.
* **Force Transfer**: Enables the transfer of tokens from one account to another without the token holder's consent, often used in cases of legal or regulatory necessity.
* **Dividends**: Programs dividend payments for equity tokens, specifying how and when dividends will be distributed to token holders. It also provides an overview of all programmed dividend payouts, including past, pending, or upcoming payments, allowing the issuer or investor to track distributions.
* **Balances**: Shows the balance of tokens held by various investors, offering a snapshot of current token holdings for the selected security.
* **Blocked List**: Manages a list of blocked or restricted investors who are prohibited from participating in token transactions, ensuring compliance with KYC/AML requirements.
* **Voting Rights**: Assigns, adjusts, or displays voting rights for security token holders, allowing them to participate in governance decisions, such as corporate actions or board elections.
* **Role Management**: Enables the assignment and management of roles (e.g., Admin, Minter, Controller) for specific users, determining their permissions and access to various operations within the digital security.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/asset-tokenization-digital-security-details-admin-mode.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Holder (mode) Dashboard

* **Transfer**: Allows token holders to send their security tokens to another account or wallet, following any compliance rules.
* **Redeem**: Enables token holders to return their tokens to the issuer in exchange for cash, removing them from circulation.
* **Balance**: Displays the token holder's current balance, providing a real-time view of the total tokens held for the selected asset.
