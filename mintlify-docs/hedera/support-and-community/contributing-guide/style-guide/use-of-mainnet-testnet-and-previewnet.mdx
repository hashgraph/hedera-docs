Do **not** capitalize *`mainnet`*, *`testnet`*, or *`previewnet`,* even when preceded by **Hedera** (e.g., Hedera mainnet,Hedera testnet,Hedera previewnet). Always use lowercase.

Apply this rule in all contexts, including documentation, website, UI text, diagrams, and developer tutorials. Avoid capitalizing these terms in headings unless they begin the sentence or heading.
