## Overview

The **Balances endpoints** in the Hedera Mirror Node REST API allows developers to query **account balances** on the Hedera network. These endpoints provides real-time and historical balance data, essential for wallets, explorers, and financial applications.

## Endpoints

The following endpoint is available for the Balances object:

| **Endpoint**           | **Description**                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `GET /api/v1/balances` | Retrieves a list of account balances. |

## Balances <a href="#balances" id="balances"></a>

The **balance** object represents the balance of accounts on the Hedera network. You can retrieve this to view the **most recent** balance of all the accounts on the network at that given time. The balances object returns the account ID and the balance in HBAR. Balances are checked on a periodic basis and thus return the most recent snapshot of time captured prior to the request.

The **balance object** represents the balance of accounts on the Hedera network. It allows you to retrieve the **most recent** snapshot of all account balances on the network at a given time. Since balances are updated periodically, the returned values reflect the latest recorded state before the request.

Each **balance object** includes:

* **Account ID** – The Hedera account being queried.
* **Balance (in HBAR)** – The most recent balance available.
* **Token Balances (if applicable)** – Associated token balances for the account.

#### Note

Balance information returned by this API has a 15 minute granularity when using the `timestamp` query parameter, as it's generated by an asynchronous balance snapshot process. When not using the `timestamp` parameter, the API returns real-time balance data.
