# Compiling Smart Contracts

Compiling a smart contract involves using the contract's source code to generate its [**bytecode**](../../support-and-community/glossary.md#bytecode) and the contract [**Application** **Binary Interface (ABI)**](../../support-and-community/glossary.md#application-binary-interface-abi). The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) executes the bytecode to understand and execute the smart contract. Meanwhile, other smart contracts use the ABI to understand how to interact with the deployed contracts on the Hedera network.

**Compiling Solidity**

The compiler for the Solidity programming language is [solc](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/installing-solidity.html) ([Solidity](../../support-and-community/glossary.md#solidity) Compiler). You can use the compiler directly or embedded in IDEs like [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/#lang=en\\&optimize=false\\&runs=200\\&evmVersion=null\\&version=soljson-v0.8.18+commit.87f61d96.js) or tools like Hardhat and Truffle.

## **Smart Contract Bytecode**

Bytecode is the machine-readable language that the EVM uses to execute smart contracts. The compiler analyzes the code, checks for syntax errors, enforces language-specific rules, and generates the corresponding bytecode.

**Example:**

This is the example bytecode output, produced in hexadecimal format, when the [`HelloHedera`](../../tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-your-first-smart-contract.md#hellohedera.sol) smart contract source code is compiled.

## **Smart Contract Application Binary Interface (ABI)**

The ABI is a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file that represents the interface definition for the smart contract. It specifies function signatures, input parameters, return types, and other relevant details of the contract's interface. The ABI helps developers understand how to interact with the smart contract in their distributed applications.

**Example:**

This is the example ABI output produced when the [`HelloHedera`](../../tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-your-first-smart-contract.md#hellohedera.sol) smart contract is compiled.

```json
"abi": [
    {
      "inputs": [
        {
          "internalType": "string",
          "name": "message_",
          "type": "string"
        }
      ],
      "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
      "type": "constructor"
    },
    {
      "inputs": [],
      "name": "get_message",
      "outputs": [
        {
          "internalType": "string",
          "name": "",
          "type": "string"
        }
      ],
      "stateMutability": "view",
      "type": "function"
    },
    {
      "inputs": [
        {
          "internalType": "string",
          "name": "message_",
          "type": "string"
        }
      ],
      "name": "set_message",
      "outputs": [],
      "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
      "type": "function"
    }
  ]
}
```

## System Smart Contracts

System smart contracts are Hedera API functionality logic presented at reserved address locations on the EVM network. These addresses contain reserved function selectors. When a deployed contract calls these selectors, they execute as though a corresponding system contract exists on the network. Both system and user-deployed contracts live at the same address. If a contract is redeployed, it gets a new address while the original address retains the old bytecode.

**System Smart Contract Interfaces**

Solidity interfaces provide and define a set of functions that other smart contracts can call. The interfaces for all Hedera systems contracts written in Solidity are maintained in the [`hedera-smart-contracts`](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-smart-contracts) repository.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** The following Solidity examples are _not_ production-ready and are intended solely for instructional purposes to guide developers.

The following is a list of available system contracts on Hedera:

### ➡ **Exchange Rate**

The exchange rate contract allows you to convert from tinycents to tinybars and from tinybars to tinycents.

| Contract Address | Source                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### ➡ **Hedera Token Service**

The [Hedera Token Service](../../support-and-community/glossary.md#hedera-token-service-hts) smart contract precompile provides functions to use the native Hedera Token Service in smart contracts. Tokens created using this method can also manage the tokens using the native Hedera Token Service APIs.

### ➡ **Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG)**

The `PRNG` system contract allows you to generate a pseudo-random number that can be used in smart contracts.
