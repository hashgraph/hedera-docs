title: "TokenFeeScheduleUpdate"
---


At consensus, updates a token type's fee schedule to the given list of custom fees. If the target token type has no fee\_schedule\_key, resolves to `TOKEN_HAS_NO_FEE_SCHEDULE_KEY.` \*\*\*\* Otherwise, this transaction must be signed to the fee\_schedule\_key, or the transaction will resolve to `INVALID_SIGNATURE`. If the custom\_fees list is empty, clears the fee schedule or resolves to `CUSTOM_SCHEDULE_ALREADY_HAS_NO_FEES` if the fee schedule was already empty.
