### Ordered Steps (Numbered List)

If the steps must be followed in a specific sequence, use a numbered list to present the order clearly. This ensures that readers understand the progression and importance of each step.

Example:

1. Clone repo.
2. cd into the cloned directory.
3. npm install

***

### Unordered Steps (Bulleted List)

If the order of the steps is not crucial to the outcome, use bulleted points. This provides flexibility for readers to approach the tasks as they prefer.

Example:

* Choose a color.
* Select a size.
* Identify a preferred style.
