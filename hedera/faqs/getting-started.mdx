  <Accordion title="What is the Hedera Developer Portal?">
    The [Hedera Developer Portal](https://portal.hedera.com/) is for anyone looking to get started building on the Hedera previewnet or testnet.

    **The Hedera Developer Portal offers the following functionalities to developers:**

    * Gain access to the Hedera testnet or previewnet for application development, via public/private key generation.
  </Accordion>

  ## Mainnet Account Creation

  <Accordion title="How do I start developing on the Hedera network? Do I need a mainnet account to start?">
    **DEVELOPMENT ACCOUNT:**

    Go to the Hedera Portal to create an account on testnet and use that for development (it's free and you don't need to buy hbar). If/when you need a mainnet account (where transactions cost real hbar), it's best to create that mainnet account through one of the supported wallets here: https://hedera.com/account-creation

    **EXAMPLES & DOCUMENTATION:**

    We have SDKs for Java, Javascript, Go, and .NET. There are examples in the GitHub repositories for the SDKs. Technical documentation is here: https://docs.hedera.com

    **HELP FROM HEDERA & COMMUNITY:**

    Reach out any time to the [Discord](http://hedera.com/discord) community of developers and Hedera employees here: https://hedera.com/[Discord](http://hedera.com/discord)

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I deploy my application on the Hedera mainnet?">
    Yes, many applications are currently deployed on the Hedera mainnet, generating millions of transactions per day. However, we recommend starting application development on the Hedera testnet, before migrating to the mainnet.

    To get started building on the Hedera testnet or mainnet, please visit the official developer documentation: https://docs.hedera.com/

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is the Hedera Mainnet not responding?">
    During the mainnet beta period, it is expected that the network will experience very brief periods of scheduled downtime for maintenance.

    Anticipated maintenance activities include adding additional nodes to the network and updating the core software running on mainnet (beta) nodes. The network's consensus state will remain unchanged in the case of any downtime or network failures, and any transactions sent to the network during periods of downtime will be rejected.

    The status of Hedera's mainnet and testnets is publicly available at https://status.hedera.com/

  </Accordion>

  ## Previewnet Account Creation

  <Accordion title="What is the Hedera Previewnet?">
    The Hedera developer community and our ecosystem partners have expressed interest in early access to Hedera codebase features and functionality, prior to their release on the Hedera testnet and mainnet. In response to this feedback, we started looking into the idea of a second testnet — the "previewnet" — which would run a development version of the Hedera codebase.

    The Hedera previewnet is designed to offer developers in the Hedera community early exposure to features coming down the pipe. It's not always stable and accounts / data are likely to be lost when the network codebase is upgraded.

    As of right now, you'll need to use the latest version of the SDK in the language of your choice to interact with the previewnet. You can find all of the Hedera SDKs in our documentation, here: https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/sdks-and-apis/sdks#sdks

    The source of truth for Hedera network, mirror node, and planned network upgrades for Hedera's mainnet, testnet, and, now, previewnet, will always be available at https://status.hedera.com/
