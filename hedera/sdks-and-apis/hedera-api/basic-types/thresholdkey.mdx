A set of public keys that are used together to form a threshold signature. If the threshold is N and there are M keys, then this is an N of M threshold signature. If an account is associated with ThresholdKeys, then a transaction to move cryptocurrency out of it must be signed by a list of M signatures, where at most M-N of them are blank, and the other at least N of them are valid signatures corresponding to at least N of the public keys listed here.
