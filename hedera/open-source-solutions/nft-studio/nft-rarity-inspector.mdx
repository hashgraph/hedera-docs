The [NFT Rarity Inspector](https://nft-studio.hashgraph.com/nft-rarity-inspector/) allows users to upload a `.zip` file to verify NFT metadata and check for compliance with [HIP-412 standards](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-412). It calculates a rarity score by analyzing the NFT's traits, features, and properties compared to the entire collection. Once the inspection is complete, each NFT is assigned a rarity score based on its uniqueness, helping artists, collectors, and traders understand its value. The higher the score, the rarer and more unique the NFT, making it more valuable than those with lower scores.

</Frame>

### Step 2: Visualize NFT Rarity, Distribution, and Attributes

After uploading the collection file, the tool will process and visually display its rarity distribution. The visualization will show some key highlights, such as:

* The **most rare NFT** in the collection.
* The **most common** **NFT** in the collection.
* The **most rare attribute** in the collection.
* The **most common attribute** found in the collection.

Next, scroll down to view a detailed rarity distribution of the entire collection, providing an overview of how rarity is spread throughout. On the top right-hand side (see image below), you‚Äôll find the **‚Äú***Attributes Rarity***‚Äù** table, which lists all attributes along with their corresponding rarity percentages, helping you understand how frequently specific traits appear in the collection.

<Accordion title="Understanding the Results">
The rarity score generated by the NFT Rarity Inspector provides valuable insights into an NFT's relative uniqueness and potential value. Here's how to interpret the results:

* The score typically ranges across a scale, where a higher score indicates a rarer NFT. The value of the score is relative to other NFTs within the same collection.
* Each NFT is also ranked within the entire collection based on its score, giving you an idea of how unique a particular NFT is compared to others.
* The tool offers a detailed breakdown of each attribute and its rarity percentage within the collection. For example, if only 5% of NFTs share a specific trait, that trait significantly boosts the NFT‚Äôs rarity score.

By understanding the rarity score and the associated ranking, you can make informed decisions about the value of each NFT within the collection.
