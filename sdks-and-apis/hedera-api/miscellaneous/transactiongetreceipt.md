# TransactionGetReceipt

## TransactionGetReceiptQuery

Get the receipt of a transaction, given its transaction ID. Once a transaction reaches consensus, then information about whether it succeeded or failed will be available until the end of the receipt period. Before and after the receipt period, and for a transaction that was never submitted, the receipt is unknown. This query is free (the payment field is left empty). No State proof is available for this response

## TransactionGetReceiptResponse

Response when the client sends the node TransactionGetReceiptQuery. If it created a new entity (account, file, or smart contract instance) then one of the three ID fields will be filled in with the ID of the new entity. Sometimes a single transaction will create more than one new entity, such as when a new contract instance is created, and this also creates the new account that it owned by that instance. No State proof is available for this response
