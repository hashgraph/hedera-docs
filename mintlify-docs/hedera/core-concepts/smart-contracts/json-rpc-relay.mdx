The [Hiero JSON-RPC Relay](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-json-rpc-relay) is an open-source project implementing the EVM JSON-RPC standard. It allows developers to interact with Hedera nodes using familiar EVM tools, allowing developers and users to deploy, query, and execute contracts as they usually would. Check out the interactive[ OpenRPC Specification](https://playground.open-rpc.org/?schemaUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashgraph/hedera-json-rpc-relay/main/docs/openrpc.json&uiSchema%5BappBar%5D%5Bui:splitView%5D=false&uiSchema%5BappBar%5D%5Bui:input%5D=false&uiSchema%5BappBar%5D%5Bui:examplesDropdown%5D=false) and a simple [list of endpoints](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-json-rpc-relay/blob/main/docs/rpc-api.md).

## HBAR decimal places

The Hiero JSON RPC Relay **`msg.value`** uses `18 decimals` when it returns HBAR. As a result, the **`gasPrice`** value returns 18 decimal places since it is only utilized from the JSON RPC Relay. Refer to the [HBAR page](/hedera/sdks-and-apis/sdks/hbars) for a list of Hiero APIs and the decimal places they return.

## JSON RPC Relay Options for the Hedera Network

When interacting with smart contracts on Hedera, developers have several options for setting up a JSON RPC Relay. Each choice comes with unique advantages and trade-offs based on your project's needs, scalability, and operational preferences.

1. [**Hiero Local Node**](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-local-node)**:** It provides a built-in JSON RPC Relay and simulates the Hedera network environment locally. This option is ideal for quick prototyping, debugging, and isolated testing without external dependencies. It's ideal if you want to run extensive and repeated tests without having to worry about running out of testnet HBAR.
2. [**Self-hosted JSON RPC Relay**](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-json-rpc-relay/tree/main)**:** Running your own JSON RPC Relay offers complete control over configurations and network selection (testnet, previewnet, mainnet). It is best suited for projects requiring flexibility, high reliability, and scalability, especially in production environments.
3. [**Third-party JSON RPC Relay Services**](#community-hosted-json-rpc-relays)**:** Several third-party providers offer managed JSON RPC Relay services with different levels of reliability, service-level agreements (SLAs), and fee structures. These services remove infrastructure maintenance overhead, allowing teams to focus more on development (*you can find the list of supported services* [*below*](#community-hosted-json-rpc-relays)*).*

| ----------------------------- | :-------------------: | :-------------------: | :------------------------------------------: |
| **Infrastructure Management** |        Minimal        |        Required       |                     None                     |
| **Reliability and Stability** |      High (local)     |          High         |                Variable by SLA               |
| **Scalability**               |       / (local)       |        Flexible       |             Variable by provider             |
| **Setup Complexity**          |     Low to Medium     |     Medium to High    |                      Low                     |
| **Ideal Use Case**            | Testing & Development |  Testing & Production | Builders who prefer convenience & Production |

## Community Hosted JSON-RPC Relays

Anyone in the community can set up their own JSON RPC relay that applications can use to deploy, query, and execute smart contracts. The list of community-hosted Hiero JSON RPC relays and endpoints for previewnet, testnet, and mainnet can be found in the table below, as well as their associated docs or websites.

### ðŸš¨ **PLEASE NOTE**

**Hashio** is for development and **testing purposes only**. Production use cases are strongly encouraged to use [commercial-grade JSON-RPC relays](#community-hosted-json-rpc-relays) or host their own instance of the [Hiero JSON-RPC Relay](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-json-rpc-relay).
